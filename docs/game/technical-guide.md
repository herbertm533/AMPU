# AMPU — Technical Guide

**How AMPU is built, and how to build into it correctly.** This is the living
companion to `CLAUDE.md` (the terse quick-reference). `/build-feature`'s architect
reads this doc; keep it accurate and current. Every claim is grounded in
`file:line`. When a forum-implied system can't yet be supported by the
architecture, this doc says so and sketches the change.

## 1. The one-paragraph mental model

AMPU is a **single-player, browser, turn-based** strategy game. The *entire* game
is one plain-old-JavaScript object — `FullGameSnapshot` (`src/types.ts:1811`). A
**pure engine** (`src/engine/*`) is a set of functions that take that snapshot and
mutate it in place; it imports no React and does no I/O. A thin **React context**
(`src/state/GameContext.tsx`) owns the snapshot in state, deep-clones it before
each engine call, runs a phase, and writes the result to **IndexedDB**
(`src/db.ts`). The turn is a fixed **phase loop** (`src/phases.ts` ⇒
`src/engine/engine.ts`). The UI is a flat **page registry** (`src/pages/registry.ts`),
keyed by `PageId`, with no router — `src/App.tsx` swaps the active page and
auto-navigates to the page that matches the current phase.

---

## 2. Architecture & data flow

### 2.1 The single-snapshot model

`FullGameSnapshot` (`src/types.ts:1811`) is the root and the unit of persistence,
autosave, export/import, and migration:

```ts
interface FullGameSnapshot {
  game: GameState;          // the singleton GameState record (id: 'game')
  politicians: Politician[];
  factions: Faction[];
  parties: Party[];
  states: State[];
  events: EventEntry[];     // the append-only log
  legislation: Legislation[];
  elections: ElectionResult[];
  wars: War[];
}
```

`GameState` (`src/types.ts:1558`) is the scalar/turn-cursor core: `year`,
`startYear`, `phaseId`/`phaseIndex`, `currentEra`, `scenarioId`,
`playerFactionId`, the national `meters`, `enthusiasm`, `interestGroups`,
`partyPreference`, the office pointers (`presidentId`, `cabinet`, `speakerId`,
`supremeCourtIds`, …), and a long tail of **per-system runtime ledgers**
(`careerGains`, `relocations`, `ideologyShifts`, `conversions`, `kingmakers`,
`factionAlignmentDrift`, `factionLeadership`, `halfTermSummaries`, …). Almost all
of these tail fields are **optional** (`?`) so older saves load without them — see
[§5 persistence/migration](#5-persistence-autosave--migration).

**Implication for features:** new persistent state goes on `GameState` (scalar /
ledger) or on the entity arrays (`Politician`, `Faction`, `State`, …). New
*per-politician* state goes on `Politician` (`src/types.ts:1251`). Make new fields
**optional** and backfill them in `repair()` (see [§5](#5-persistence-autosave--migration)).

### 2.2 Engine purity

Everything under `src/engine/*` is a **pure function over the snapshot**: takes
`snap: FullGameSnapshot`, mutates it in place, returns either `void` or a small
result object. No React imports, no IndexedDB, no `fetch`. This is what lets the
engine be unit-tested headlessly (see the `scripts/playtest*.ts` smoke harnesses)
and re-run deterministically.

- Phase runners: `src/engine/phaseRunners.ts` (4198 lines — one `runPhase_*`
  per phase plus the player-action entry points like `playerDraftPick`,
  `attemptPlayerRelocation`).
- The loop driver: `src/engine/engine.ts` (`runCurrentPhase`, `advancePhase`).
- Era subsystems: `continentalCongress.ts`, `constitutionalConvention.ts`,
  `revolutionaryWar.ts`, `firstContinentalCongress.ts`, `eraGraph.ts`,
  `territories.ts`.
- Cross-cutting helpers: `log.ts` (`addLog`), `traits.ts`
  (`addTrait`/`tryGrantTrait`), `expertise.ts` (`addExpertise`), `abilities.ts`
  (`addSkillPoint`/`loseSkill`/`addCommandPoint`/`loseCommand`),
  `electionEffects.ts` (`applyTraitElectionBonus`), `halfTermSummary.ts`,
  `labels.ts`.

**Do:** put rules in the engine, read-only derivations in pages/components.
**Don't:** mutate the snapshot from a React component — go through a
`GameContext` action, which clones → runs engine → persists.

### 2.3 The phase loop

`PHASE_SEQUENCE` (`src/phases.ts:3`) is the ordered list of ~35 phases, ids
`'2.1.1'`…`'2.10'` (`PhaseId`, `src/types.ts:1420`). The loop is:

1. `runCurrentPhase(snap)` (`src/engine/engine.ts:16`) dispatches on
   `snap.game.phaseId` via a big `switch` to the matching `runPhase_*`. It returns
   `{ needsPlayerInput?, payload?, acknowledgements? }`. `needsPlayerInput` is one
   of `'draft' | 'eraEvent' | 'cabinet' | 'convention' | 'ccBuilder' |
   'ccAIConfirm'` (`engine.ts:9,16`).
2. If input is needed, `GameContext.advance` (`src/state/GameContext.tsx:300`)
   stops, surfaces a modal or routes to a page, and **persists** — the snapshot
   rests mid-phase.
3. Otherwise `advancePhase(snap)` (`engine.ts:95`) finds the next phase that
   should run and updates the cursor.

`nextPhaseInfo` (`src/phases.ts:149`) walks forward to the next
`shouldRunPhase`-true phase; when it falls off the end it **wraps to the next turn
by `year + 2`** (`phases.ts:161`) — a turn is a half-term (two years). Year
predicates: `isElectionYear` (`% 2`), `isPresidentialYear`/`isDraftYear` (`% 4`)
(`phases.ts:49-59`).

`shouldRunPhase(phaseId, year, game?)` (`src/phases.ts:62`) is the **single gate**
for whether a phase runs this turn. It encodes both **year gating** (no
presidential election off-cycle) and **era gating** (e.g. independence era skips
all of 2.3 cabinet/2.8 executive; 2.9.6 becomes the First-CC builder only under a
specific 1772 predicate chain at `phases.ts:111-122`). **This is the function you
extend when a new system or era changes which phases fire.**

### 2.4 Determinism (and where it's currently violated)

`src/rng.ts` exposes the RNG wrappers the engine *should* use: `rand`, `d`,
`d100`, `rollVs`, `pickWeighted`, `pick`, `shuffle`, `chance`, `clamp`, `uid`.
The header comment (`rng.ts:1-2`) is honest: **today these wrap `Math.random`
directly** (`rng.ts:5`) and seeding is a "plug in later" stub. So the engine is
*deterministic in shape* (re-running the same phase produces the same kind of
result) but **not reproducible** (no seed ⇒ different rolls each run).

CLAUDE.md's rule — "keep engine code deterministic; don't use `Math.random`" — is
about a stronger discipline: **always go through the `rng.ts` wrappers, never call
`Math.random` directly**, so that when a real seeded PRNG is dropped into
`rng.ts`, the whole engine becomes reproducible in one change. That discipline is
**partially violated today** (raw `Math.random` in 5 engine spots — see
[§8 tech debt](#8-tech-debt--risks)). New engine code must use the wrappers.

### 2.5 The append-only log

`addLog(snap, phase, category, text, meta?)` (`src/engine/log.ts:4`) pushes an
`EventEntry` (`src/types.ts:1439`) onto `snap.events`. Categories are a fixed
union (`death | retire | election | legislation | event | appointment | system |
meter | draft | war | court | roll`). This feed drives most pages. The
`EventEntry.meta` bag carries structured extras (e.g. `{ politicianId }`) that
pages read for cross-linking. There is also a **per-half-term structured summary**
(`halfTermSummary.ts`) opened at the top of each turn and closed at 2.10, read by
the End-of-Half-Term page and Campaign-Over recap.

---

## 3. Persistence, autosave & migration

### 3.1 IndexedDB layout

`src/db.ts` defines an `idb` schema (`AmpuDB`, `db.ts:15`) with one object store
per snapshot array (`game`, `politicians`, `factions`, …) plus a few indexes
(`by-faction`, `by-party`, `by-year`). `loadSnapshot` (`db.ts:106`) reassembles
the snapshot; `saveSnapshot` (`db.ts:123`) writes every store in one transaction
and stamps `game.lastSavedAt`. `exportJson`/`importJson` (`db.ts:163-173`) are the
save-file path and also what the user's CSV-import flow rides on.

### 3.2 Autosave

`GameContext.persist` (`src/state/GameContext.tsx:84`) = `saveSnapshot` + set
`hasSave`. **Every** context action that mutates calls `persist` after the engine
runs — including the ones that ran on a *failed* roll. The relocation/ideology/
conversion actions return a boolean meaning "the attempt RAN (mutated cooldown/
counter/feed) and must persist" vs. "rejected, nothing changed"
(`GameContext.tsx:588-615`). So the game **autosaves on every phase advance and
every player action** — there is no explicit save button.

### 3.3 Migration discipline — `repair()`, NOT `DB_VERSION`

This is the most important and most counter-intuitive part of the persistence
story. **`DB_VERSION` is hard-coded `1` (`db.ts:60`) and has never been bumped.**
The `idb` `upgrade` callback (`db.ts:67`) only ever *creates* stores; it does no
data migration. All save-shape migration happens **in application code** in
`repair()` (`src/state/GameContext.tsx:91-239`), which runs on every load
(`GameContext.tsx:254`, `:278`) before the snapshot is surfaced to the UI.

`repair()` is an idempotent, dirty-flagged sweep that:
- repairs stuck draft schedules (`GameContext.tsx:94`),
- backfills fields added after launch (`draftedYear`, `draftHistory`,
  `halfTermSummaries`, `careerGains`) (`:101-156`),
- strips now-invalid card ids and legacy office/trait strings
  (`:157-168`, `:169-192`),
- migrates the 8 legacy "expertise-as-trait" strings onto the expertise axis
  (PR1, `:173-192`),
- drops legacy cabinet seats (PR5, `:196-218`),
- backfills `loyalty` (PR6, `:219-237`).

**The migration playbook for a new feature** (do this, not a `DB_VERSION` bump):
1. Add the new field as **optional** on the type.
2. Add an **idempotent** backfill block in `repair()` that inits it when missing
   and sets `dirty = true`. Pattern: `if (s.game.newField == null) { s.game.newField = <default>; dirty = true; }`.
3. If you removed/renamed a field, add a defensive strip block (see the card-id
   filter at `:157` for the template).
4. `repair()` returns `dirty ? { ...s } : s` (`:238`); the caller re-saves only if
   the object identity changed (`:256`, `:280`).

> **Risk:** because there's no schema version, `repair()` is the *only* line of
> defense and it grows unbounded. A genuinely incompatible store-level change
> (new object store, changed keyPath) **would** need a `DB_VERSION` bump + an
> `upgrade` migration — there is no precedent for that yet. See [§8](#8-tech-debt--risks).

---

## 4. The page registry (no router)

`src/pages/registry.ts` exports `PageId` (a string union, `registry.ts:37`) and
`Pages: Record<PageId, () => JSX.Element>` (`registry.ts:74`). `src/App.tsx`
holds the current `page` in `useState` (`App.tsx:14`) and renders `Pages[page]`
(`App.tsx:345`). There is **no URL routing** — navigation is `setPage(...)`,
threaded to pages via `NavigationContext` (`App.tsx:353`) and to the sidebar.

**Phase-driven auto-navigation:** `App.tsx` has ~20 `useEffect`s (`App.tsx:38`…)
that watch `snapshot.game.phaseId` + `year` and `setPage(...)` to the page for the
current phase, using a `lastXEntryKey` ref keyed on `${year}:${phaseId}` so it
navigates **once per phase visit** and never yanks the player back after they
click away. **To wire a new interactive phase to its page:** add a `PageId` +
component in `registry.ts`, then add one such effect in `App.tsx` following the
exact ref-key pattern.

Modals are separate from pages: `GameContext` owns a `Modal` union
(`GameContext.tsx:14`) for the era-event and convention surfaces; `App.tsx:358`
renders them.

---

## 5. Data & scenario layout

`src/data/` holds two kinds of content: **scenario builders** and **seed/era
content**.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `scenario1772.ts` (`build1772Scenario`) | Founding scenario; starts `currentEra: 'independence'`, phase `2.1.1`, full pool expansion draft. |
| `scenario1856.ts` (`build1856Scenario`) | Antebellum scenario; starts `currentEra: 'nationalism'`, phase `2.1.2` (rookie crop pre-seeded), bicameral constitution already ratified. |
| `states1772.ts` / `states1856.ts` | Colony/state rosters. |
| `factions1772.ts` / `factions1856.ts` | Seed factions, parties, interest groups. |
| `politicians1772.ts` / `politicians1856.ts` | Seed/filler politicians (note: `politicians1856.ts` uses raw `Math.random` 12× — author-time fill, see §8). |
| `eraEvents1772.ts` (`ERA_GRAPH_1772`) | The **independence-era event graph** (see §6.4). |
| `eraEvents1856.ts`, `anytimeEvents.ts`, `anytimeNationalEvents.ts` | 1856 era events; anytime-event pools. |
| `expansionStates.ts` | Post-founding admittable states (`admitState`). |
| `defaultDraftClasses.ts`, `standardDraftClasses.ts`, `draftImport.ts` | The draft dataset (see §7). |

A scenario builder returns a fully-formed `FullGameSnapshot`: it instantiates
politicians, seats Senators/Reps/Governors, wires the cabinet/court, sets starting
`meters`/`enthusiasm`/`interestGroups`, builds the snake draft order, and stamps
the `GameState`. The two builders are the template for any new scenario.

---

## 6. Patterns & conventions

### 6.1 Where the rules constants live

**All tunable rule numbers live as exported `const` objects in `src/types.ts`,
co-located with the types they govern.** This is deliberate: the human dials
balance there without touching engine bodies, and engine code stays free of magic
numbers. The full set (with line anchors):

| Const | `src/types.ts` | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `CAREER_ODDS`, `TRACK_*` tables | `:194-237` | Career-track skill/trait/expertise rolls (2.1.2) |
| `RELOCATION_ODDS`, `CARPETBAGGER_LADDER` | `:241-250` | Relocations (2.1.4) |
| `IDEOLOGY_SHIFT_ODDS` | `:253` | Ideology drift/shift (2.1.5) |
| `CONVERSION_ODDS` | `:268` | Faction conversion/poaching (2.1.6) |
| `KINGMAKER_RULES` | `:295` | Kingmaker/protégé (2.1.7) |
| `ALIGNMENT_RULES`, `LOBBY_*`, `EXPERTISE_IDEOLOGY_LEAN`, `LOBBY_RULES` | `:330-432` | Faction personality/alignment drift (2.1.8) |
| `LEADERSHIP_RULES` (per-era `eraConfig`) | `:438` | Faction-leader challenges |
| `MORTALITY_RULES` (per-era `eraConfig`) | `:485` | Deaths/retirements (2.4.1) |
| `ABILITY_LOSS_RULES`, `ABILITY_EARN_RULES` | `:518-585` | Skill/command gain & decay |
| `OFFICE_*_GRANT`, `OFFICE_EXPERTISE`, `COMMITTEE_EXPERTISE`, `CABINET_SEAT_SCORING` | `:590-1242` | Office→stat/expertise grants, cabinet scoring (2.3.1) |
| `TRAIT_LIFECYCLE_RULES`, `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` | `:624-692` | Trait erosion + symmetric conflict pairs |
| `TRAIT_ELECTION_BANDS`, `TRAIT_ELECTION_EFFECTS` (+`ElectionContext`) | `:697-978` | Per-trait per-context election magnitudes (2.9) |
| `TRAIT_GOVERNANCE_BANDS`, `TRAIT_GOVERNANCE_EFFECTS` (+`GovernanceContext`) | `:980-1071` | Per-trait governance/crisis magnitudes |
| `ANYTIME_EVENTS_RULES` (per-era), `ERA_GRAPH_RULES` | `:1073-1105` | Anytime events; 1772 graph walker |
| `cabinetSeatsForYear(year)`, `LOYALTY_*` | `:1152-1208` | Era-conditional cabinet seats; Secession-Winter loyalty |

Pattern to copy: a `Record<…, …> as const satisfies <shape>` keyed by `Era` for
anything era-scaled (`MORTALITY_RULES.eraConfig` at `:507` is the cleanest
template). The election/governance effects use a **flat array of rule rows**
(`TraitElectionRule[]`) rather than nested records, because several rows need
cross-cutting `era` / `opponentConditional` qualifiers — follow that shape for any
new context-scaled trait effect.

### 6.2 The mutation-helper idioms (gate-the-log pattern)

The cross-cutting helpers all share one contract: **mutate, and return `true`
iff something actually changed**, so callers gate their `addLog` on a real change
and re-grants are silent no-ops.

- `addExpertise(p, tag)` — `src/engine/expertise.ts:5`. Dedupe-on-insert.
- `addTrait(p, t)` / `removeTrait(p, t)` — `src/engine/traits.ts:8,15`. Raw, no
  conflict logic.
- `tryGrantTrait(p, t)` — `src/engine/traits.ts:41`. **Conflict-aware** grant:
  consults `TRAIT_CONFLICTS`, d6-arbitrates a held opposite (threshold from
  `TRAIT_LIFECYCLE_RULES.conflictD6Threshold`), returns `{ granted, replaced }`.
  Route *earned* traits through this, not `addTrait`.
- `addSkillPoint(p, key, amt)` / `loseSkill` / `addCommandPoint` / `loseCommand`
  — `src/engine/abilities.ts:6-38`. Clamp `[0,5]`; **probability is decided at the
  call site, never inside the helper** (the helpers are deterministic).
- `addLog(snap, phase, category, text, meta?)` — `src/engine/log.ts:4`.

Canonical call shape (from the cabinet/committee grant pattern,
`phaseRunners.ts:434`, `:485`, `:1930`):

```ts
if (chance(odds) && addExpertise(p, xp)) {
  addLog(snap, '2.1.2', 'appointment', `${name} gains ${xp} expertise.`);
}
```

After mutating `skills`/`command`/`traits`/`currentOffice`, recompute PV with
`refreshPv(politicians)` (`src/pv.ts:91`) at a natural boundary (the draft and
scenario builders do this; per-phase runners that change PV-affecting fields
should too).

### 6.3 PV — the election currency

`computePV(p)` (`src/pv.ts:67`) folds office-weighted skills (`officeWeights`,
`pv.ts:33`), command, trait bumps (+4 positive / −5 negative, `pv.ts:75-78`),
office prestige (`OFFICE_PRESTIGE`, `pv.ts:7`), faction-leader bonus, and age
penalties into a single number cached on `Politician.pvCache`. **PV feeds
elections directly** (`calcStateVote` reads `c.pvCache`, `phaseRunners.ts:3699`,
`:3709`) and draft order (`phaseRunners.ts:122-126`). The CLAUDE.md warning
stands: changing the PV formula reweights every election and draft at once — do it
deliberately and re-playtest.

### 6.4 Era-event content as data (the 1772 graph)

The independence era models its event chain as a **serializable graph**, the
cleanest "content is data, not code" pattern in the repo and the model to imitate
for future eras:

- `ERA_GRAPH_1772: GraphNode[]` (`src/data/eraEvents1772.ts:58`). Each `GraphNode`
  (`eraEvents1772.ts:19`) has a stable `templateId`, a `chartIndex`, an optional
  **`precondition: Predicate`**, an `aiBias` map, and a `build(year) ⇒ EraEvent`.
- `Predicate` (`src/types.ts:1487`) is a **serializable precondition tree**
  (`all`/`any`/`not`/`yearAtLeast`/`eventChose`/`meterAtLeast`/`warOutcome`/…).
  One pure interpreter, `evalPredicate(snap, pred)` (`src/engine/eraGraph.ts:12`),
  walks it. Preconditions are *data* — inspectable and testable, no code per node.
- The walker `selectEraGraphNode` (`eraGraph.ts:107`) picks the next eligible node
  (core spine fires immediately; otherwise history-pressure-weighted spine-vs-
  counterfactual, then a probabilistic fire roll), `build`s it, and queues it.
- AI auto-resolution: `isAutoResolved` + `pickAIResponse` (`eraGraph.ts:78,88`)
  resolve nodes the player doesn't control by the controlling faction's
  personality — mirroring the convention CPU-consensus precedent.
- A dev-only `validate()` (`eraGraph.ts:147`) asserts authoring invariants
  (no President/Cabinet decider pre-1789, `chartIndex < 49` to stop before
  Federalism, an anachronism denylist).

The 1856 era currently uses a simpler per-year pool rebuild
(`GameContext.tsx:544-548` clears `pendingEraEvents` each turn for 1856 but keeps
the resolved 1772 nodes durable for `eventChose` predicates). **For a new era,
prefer the graph model.**

### 6.5 How a new phase is wired end-to-end

1. Add the id to `PhaseId` (`src/types.ts:1420`) and a row to `PHASE_SEQUENCE`
   (`src/phases.ts:3`) in the right ordinal slot.
2. Add gating to `shouldRunPhase` (`src/phases.ts:62`) if it's year- or
   era-conditional.
3. Write `runPhase_X(snap)` in `src/engine/phaseRunners.ts` (pure; rng via
   wrappers; mutate snapshot; `addLog`).
4. Add a `case` in `runCurrentPhase`'s switch (`src/engine/engine.ts:25`). If it
   needs player input, return a `needsPlayerInput` discriminant and handle it in
   the matching `GameContext` action.
5. If interactive, add a `PageId` + component (`src/pages/registry.ts`) and an
   auto-nav effect in `src/App.tsx` (§4).
6. Put all tunables in a rules const in `src/types.ts` (§6.1).

---

## 7. The draft-dataset pipeline (author-time)

The bundled "standard draft classes" are **generated**, not hand-written. Do NOT
hand-edit `src/data/defaultDraftClasses.ts`,
`public/standard-draft-classes.json`, or `politicians-dataset.csv` — edit the
scripts and regenerate. (See `docs/draft-class-authoring.md` for the
who-to-include conventions.)

- `scripts/seedDataset.mjs` — curated authoring source: `CURATED_ROWS` (marquee
  figures; **override** same-named dataset entries) and `ERA_FIGURES` (founding
  notables who never served; **additive-only**).
- `scripts/fetchLegislators.sh` — downloads sources into `.legis/` (gitignored):
  the `unitedstates/congress-legislators` YAML + MEDSL election CSVs.
- `scripts/legislatorsToDataset.mjs` — the merge (`legislatorsToDataset.mjs:256`
  onward). Merge precedence: served members < `CURATED_ROWS` (overlay at `:271`);
  `ERA_FIGURES` (`:292`) and MEDSL failed candidates (`:307`) are added only if no
  same-name person exists within ~25 years (`ERA_SAME_PERSON_WINDOW`, `:282`).
  Emits the runtime JSON (`:316`), the review CSV (`:329`), and the small offline
  fallback `defaultDraftClasses.ts` (`:344`).

**Dataset rules** (enforced in the script): `draftYear = round((birthYear+25)/4)*4`
clamped ≥ 1772 (`draftYearFor`, `legislatorsToDataset.mjs:25`); failed candidates
get **sub-floor** electoral stats (`legislative ≤ 1`, low command — `mkLoser`,
`:231`) so they rarely win.

**Runtime load:** `loadStandardDraftClasses` (`src/data/standardDraftClasses.ts:13`)
fetches the ~18.5k JSON on app mount and swaps it into the synchronously-read
`STANDARD_DRAFT_CLASSES` export; the curated built-in is the fallback if the fetch
fails/times out (raced against a 12s timeout, `GameContext.tsx:247-250`). The
draft runner instantiates the year's class via `instantiateDraftees`
(`phaseRunners.ts:114-175`), with per-game user imports
(`game.customDraftClasses`) taking precedence over the bundled set.

**Regenerate:** `bash scripts/fetchLegislators.sh && node scripts/legislatorsToDataset.mjs && npm run build`.

## 8. Tech debt & risks

| # | Issue | Location | Impact / fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Raw `Math.random` in election scoring** | `phaseRunners.ts:3711` (`calcStateVote`'s `(Math.random()-0.5)*8` jitter) | The flagship determinism leak — every state vote is unseeded. Blocks reproducible elections (and any future replay/multiplayer sync). Route through `rng.ts`. |
| 2 | **Raw `Math.random` elsewhere in the engine** | draft rookie fallback gen `phaseRunners.ts:188-198`; war resolution `:3603`; court pressure `:3711`; `revolutionaryWar.ts:89,97`; `continentalCongress.ts:271` | Same class of bug. **13 raw calls across the engine** (10 in `phaseRunners.ts` incl. #1; 2 in `revolutionaryWar.ts`; 1 in `continentalCongress.ts`). `eraGraph.ts` is already clean — its only `Math.random` mention is the "no Math.random" comment at `:8`. Migrate all to `rng.ts` wrappers as part of the seeding work. |
| 3 | **`rng.ts` is not actually seeded** | `rng.ts:1-5` | The wrappers exist but wrap `Math.random`. Determinism is *aspirational* until a real PRNG (e.g. mulberry32/xoshiro) is dropped in and a seed is stored on `GameState`. Prerequisite for replay + multiplayer. |
| 4 | **No `DB_VERSION` migration path** | `db.ts:60`; `repair()` `GameContext.tsx:91` | All migration is app-side `repair()`. Fine for additive fields; **a store-level change has no precedent** and would need a real `idb` upgrade. `repair()` also grows unbounded. |
| 5 | **`nationalism`/`modern` eras are partly inert** | only transition is `constitutionalConvention.ts:198` (`→ 'federalism'`) | `Era` has 4 values and rules consts key all 4, but **no runtime path enters `nationalism` or `modern`** — 1856 *starts* in `nationalism` and never advances. New eras need both content *and* a transition trigger. See §9. |
| 6 | **Snapshot is single-deep-cloned per action** | `GameContext.tsx:302` etc. (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(snapshot))`) | Whole-snapshot clone + whole-snapshot `saveSnapshot` (`db.ts:123` writes every store every time) is O(everything) per action. Fine at current sizes (~hundreds–thousands of politicians); a concern as the dataset/era count grows. |
| 7 | **Engine `switch` + `GameContext` action duplication** | `engine.ts:25`; `GameContext.tsx` actions | Each interactive phase is wired in two places (engine discriminant + context handler + App effect). Adding phases is mechanical but spread across files — easy to half-wire. |
| 8 | **Per-game dataset stored on the save** | `game.customDraftClasses` (`types.ts:1631`) | User-imported draftees travel inside the snapshot, so they bloat every autosave/export. Acceptable now; watch as datasets grow. |

### The two deltas

- **(A) Multiplayer.** The forum game has **multiple human players**; the build is
  strictly single-player. The snapshot has exactly one `playerFactionId`
  (`types.ts:1566`) and one `isPlayer` faction (`types.ts:1303`); every "is this
  me?" check keys off it (e.g. `eraGraph.ts` `playerControlsDecider`,
  `phaseRunners.ts` faction-scan gates). AI resolves everyone else.
- **(B) Many more eras** beyond 1772/1856 — an 1800s → Gilded Age line. The era
  scaffold *mostly exists* (the `Era` union, era-keyed `eraConfig`s, the
  serializable 1772 graph) but is **not exercised past `federalism`** (debt #5).

### Recommended order (most-foundational first)

**0. Seed the RNG (foundational for everything, do first).** Replace
`Math.random` in `rng.ts` with a real seeded PRNG, store the seed + a call-count
(or PRNG state) on `GameState`, and migrate the ~15 raw `Math.random` engine
calls (debt #1, #2) to the wrappers. *Why first:* determinism is the
**prerequisite for multiplayer** (clients/turns must agree on roll outcomes) and
it makes every future feature testable and replayable. Cheap relative to its
leverage. **Size: S–M. Risk: low** (mechanical, but touches many files — do it
before the codebase grows further).

**1. New eras before multiplayer.** Eras are a *content + extension-point*
problem on the existing single-player loop; multiplayer is a *turn-model
rearchitecture*. Eras compound the value of the engine you already have and
surface the extension points multiplayer will also need (clean era transitions,
data-driven content). Multiplayer built first would have to be re-validated
against every later era. **So: eras (1) → multiplayer (2).**

#### Delta B — new eras (build second; sketch)

Architectural changes, in dependency order:
1. **An era-transition mechanism.** Today the only transition is hard-coded in the
   convention (`constitutionalConvention.ts:198`). Generalize to a small
   `advanceEra(snap)` (pure) driven by a trigger (year threshold and/or a
   terminal era-event), called from the loop or 2.10. *This is the keystone — debt
   #5 — and blocks everything else here.*
2. **Per-era content registries.** Lift the 1772 graph pattern into an
   era-indexed registry: `ERA_GRAPH_<era>` + an era→graph lookup in the walker
   (`eraGraph.ts:107` currently hard-imports `ERA_GRAPH_1772`). Same for anytime
   pools and scenario seed data. Keep the serializable `Predicate` tree
   (`types.ts:1487`) — it already supports `yearAtLeast`/`meterAtLeast`/etc., so
   most new-era gating needs **no new code**, only new data rows.
3. **Era-keyed config fill-in.** The `eraConfig` consts
   (`LEADERSHIP_RULES`/`MORTALITY_RULES`/`ANYTIME_EVENTS_RULES`) already key all 4
   `Era`s — a Gilded Age era reuses `nationalism`/`modern` or adds a 5th union
   member (one-line `Era` change + fill every `eraConfig`; the
   `satisfies Record<Era, …>` will flag any you miss — a nice safety net).
4. **Phase-gating + offices per era.** Extend `shouldRunPhase` (`phases.ts:62`)
   and `cabinetSeatsForYear` (`types.ts:1196`) for any era-specific phase/office
   changes (e.g. the 17th-Amendment direct-Senate election the election contexts
   already anticipate via `senatePre17`, `types.ts:697`).
5. **Save migration.** Each new era field is additive ⇒ optional + `repair()`
   backfill (§3.3). No `DB_VERSION` bump unless a store changes.

*Gotchas:* PV is global, so new-era offices/traits reweight elections (§6.3) —
re-tune. New territories ride `expansionStates.ts` + `admitState`. New eras change
which phases fire — `shouldRunPhase` is the single chokepoint; get it right or
phases silently skip. **Size per era: M (mostly content) once the keystone
transition + registry (steps 1–2) land, which are M on their own. Risk: medium**
(balance, not architecture).

#### Delta A — multiplayer (build third; sketch)

This is the deep one. The snapshot/turn model assumes one human:
1. **Generalize "the player" to "a player."** Replace the singleton
   `playerFactionId` (`types.ts:1566`) + single `isPlayer` (`types.ts:1303`) with
   a set of human-controlled factions, and audit every read of those two fields
   (and `playerControlsDecider`, the faction-scan gates, the `autoPickForPlayer`/
   sim-draft paths) to ask "is *a* human controlling this decider/seat?" instead
   of "is it *the* human?". **Size: M. Risk: medium** — many call sites, but
   mechanical once the helper exists.
2. **A turn/seat model.** Decide the multiplayer cadence. Two viable shapes:
   - *Hot-seat / sequential (cheapest):* the existing `needsPlayerInput`
     mechanism already pauses mid-phase per decider — extend it to round-robin
     across human factions before `advancePhase`. Reuses the whole loop. **Size:
     M.**
   - *Async forum-style (true to the source):* persist per-faction pending
     decisions, let humans submit out of band, resolve when all are in. This is a
     **server + shared-state** problem — IndexedDB is per-browser
     (`db.ts`), so it needs a backend (or CRDT/host-authoritative sync) the repo
     **does not have today**. **Size: L–XL. Risk: high.**
3. **Determinism is a hard prerequisite** (step 0). With shared/async state, every
   client must derive identical roll outcomes from the seed; today's unseeded
   `Math.random` makes that impossible. Multiplayer **cannot** be correct until
   step 0 lands.
4. **Whole-snapshot clone+save** (debt #6) becomes a real bottleneck with multiple
   players poking state; expect to move to per-store/delta writes.

*Bottom line on A:* hot-seat sequential is a believable M on top of the current
architecture **after** step 0; true async forum multiplayer is an L–XL that
introduces a backend AMPU has never had — scope it as its own epic, not a feature.

### One-line ordering

**0) Seed the RNG → 1) era-transition keystone + per-era content registry → 2)
add the new-era content → 3) multiplayer (hot-seat first; async forum sync only as
a separate backend epic).**

## 10. Build / lint / test commands

- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Production build (typecheck + build — run before calling code done): `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`)
- Typecheck only: `npm run lint` (`tsc -b --noEmit`)
- Preview built app: `npm run preview`
- Engine smoke tests: the `scripts/playtest*.ts` / `scripts/smokeTest*.mjs`
  harnesses run engine helpers headlessly (no React) — the model for
  feature-level verification (the qa-tester role writes these).
- Regenerate the draft dataset: see §7.

**Definition of done** (from CLAUDE.md): `npm run build` passes **and** the change
is playtested in `npm run dev` — build/typecheck prove correctness, not that the
game is fun or balanced (that judgment is human). Pushing/PRs are human-approved
checkpoints.
