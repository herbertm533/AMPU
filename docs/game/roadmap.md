# AMPU — Roadmap

> **Batch-8 version — CONFIDENCE-HARDENING pass (NO re-sequence). The two 1772
> threads + the multi-save era-model proof.**
> Batch 8 is **not a re-sequence**: the tech-lead confirmed no new keystones and
> no structural change. It (1) bumps **K3/K4 (the era model) to HIGHEST
> confidence** — now **MULTI-SAVE PROVEN** (two independent saves, 1772-start +
> 1800-start, 28 in-game years apart, emit identical era-bands at identical dates;
> game-context #102 / `tea1772` + `rep1800`); (2) **strengthens E16's
> justification** (`cabinetSeatsForYear` is now confirmed the WRONG model at BOTH
> ends of the timeline — founding offices-by-law + modern bill-creates-a-seat);
> (3) **adds ONE author-before-build parking-lot item** (DH-41, the general
> SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade — UNBUILT, `vcczar`-deferred → 10
> total); (4) **folds the new small mechanics #100/#103/#104/#105 + DH-38/39/40/42/
> 43/44 into existing epics**; (5) records a **★ NEGATIVE RESULT** — no thread
> reaches a "future" era, so the roadmap does **NOT** scope one; and (6) cites
> **DH-36 (GM-burnout abandoned a 12-turn game)** as the META justification for the
> whole build. The two 1772 threads — **`new1772`** (the first MULTIPLAYER 1772
> founding campaign, abandoned at GM burnout) + **`tea1772`** (a solo all-CPU
> 1772→1874 fast-traversal that stalls mid-Gilded) — are the batch-8 sources.
> Order is **unchanged**: build top-to-bottom. The top of the queue is still
> **QW0 → K0/K2 → K3/K4 …**.
>
> **Batch-7 version — re-sequenced for the "Era of Republicanism 1800-1868"
> early-republic gap-fill.**
> This roadmap was stood up from the codebase + tech-lead bootstrap (6 items),
> rebuilt against batch 1 (`f4c7c2c4`, 1868 Gilded-Age → 14 items), re-sequenced
> into **two parallel tracks** for batch 2 (`f55d3e21` 1788 federalism + `85f8e6b4`
> 1772 aesthetic), re-sequenced into **three engine phases** for batch 3
> (`3a9ac985`, the 2276-post modern campaign), re-sequenced for batch 4 to absorb
> `77db6e6f` (the **9051-post 1856-native "A House Divided" Part 2** — the only
> source for the Civil-War / Reconstruction / secession machinery),
> re-sequenced for batch 5 to absorb `e1776bbd` — the **7540-post all-CPU
> 1841→1924 "Drums of War"** playtest (the first explicit forum record of CPU
> heuristics, thresholds, tie-breaks, and formulas) — re-sequenced for batch 6
> to absorb `c50d9da7` (a **1172-post, multiplayer "Era of Populism" 2012
> fresh-modern boot**) — and is now **re-sequenced for batch 7**, which absorbed
> `rep1800` — the **"Era of Republicanism" 1800→1868 campaign**, the first
> procedural record of the 1800–1856 early republic (Jeffersonian →
> Era-of-Good-Feelings → Jacksonian → Manifest-Destiny → Nationalism), the
> **predecessor of batch-1's `gilded`** — so **the 1800 campaign is now
> documented end-to-end**. Order within each track is binding from
> `technical-guide.md` §9.6 + **§9.1.5 / §9.1.6 / §9.1.7** + §6.6.1 — **build
> top-to-bottom.**
>
> **What changed vs. the batch-7 roadmap** (all from §9 batch-8 lead +
> §9.1.5's batch-8 confidence bump + the divergence-row updates, binding —
> **CONFIDENCE + small placements, NOT a re-sequence**):
> 1. **★ K3/K4 (the era model) → HIGHEST confidence: MULTI-SAVE PROVEN.** The
>    batch-7 reframe was inferred from a single 1800-start campaign (`rep1800`).
>    Batch 8 adds a fully *independent* save — `tea1772` (a 1772-start solo all-CPU
>    traversal, **28 in-game years earlier**) — that emits the **identical
>    era-band sequence** (Federalists → Republicanism → Democracy → Manifest-Destiny
>    → Nationalism) at the **same in-game dates**. Two saves, two start years, one
>    deterministic band sequence ⇒ the bands are **game-state content-gates, not
>    flavor**. **Nothing structural changes** — the K3/K4 spec was already
>    condition-driven from batch 7. This is a **priority/confidence raise only**:
>    the era keystones are now the **safest large bet in the roadmap**; treat the
>    content-band model as **settled**. **#102's dual era-scoring (per-era winner +
>    cumulative "winner so far") is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard — it folds into
>    K3/K4's per-era point-banking (#68 banks the cumulative total); the win
>    condition is DUAL.** K3 + K4 rows + the Phase-0 preamble UPDATED (confidence,
>    not scope).
> 2. **★ E16 (dynamic cabinet-seat refactor / divergence #15) — justification
>    STRENGTHENED, no new work.** `cabinetSeatsForYear` (`types.ts:1196`) is now
>    confirmed the WRONG model at **BOTH ends of the timeline**: founding offices-
>    by-law (`new1772` — SCOTUS/Bank/Navy/AG/academies built by bills) AND modern
>    (`pop` — a Climate bill creates a cabinet seat). So the seat-list-as-mutable-
>    state refactor is **foundational to the offices-as-data theme, not a
>    modern-only nicety.** E16 row UPDATED (harder justification, same scope).
> 3. **★ DH-41 — ONE new author-before-build PARKING-LOT item (now 10 total).**
>    The general **SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade** (a ruling that
>    *contradicts a law on the books* auto-voiding it) is **UNBUILT and was
>    explicitly DEFERRED by `vcczar`** (`tea1772` POST 124-126, Prigg→Fugitive-
>    Slave-Act). Today a contradicting ruling leaves the law operative. Distinct
>    from the *built* strike-a-single-law + the #100 overturn-an-amendment path.
>    **Author the cascade policy before building it; lands in the SCOTUS docket
>    (E25) once decided.**
> 4. **Small placements (fold into existing epics, no new rows):** #100
>    SCOTUS-overturns-a-ratified-Amendment + threshold-amendable → the amendments
>    item (E5) + SCOTUS docket (E25); #103 presidential-vote modifier stack +
>    era-stamped issue list → election-math / bill-scoring (E20); #104 lone-ideology
>    convention exploit → the convention CPU handler guard (E9 handler 9e); #105
>    stat-collapse → forced presidential resignation → succession (E10b).
> 5. **DH classification (place, don't necessarily schedule):** DH-38 (no
>    late-ratification / "Rogue Island" window) → E1 federalism/founding;
>    DH-39 (all-human Convention deadlock) → convention machinery (multiplayer);
>    DH-40 (SCOTUS-justice-count bill not auto-packaged → game STALLS) → an XS-S
>    bug-fix in the bill-packaging / SCOTUS-establish path (E14b / E25); DH-42
>    (national-meters swamp per-state lean → no close elections) → election-math
>    BALANCE (E4 / E20); DH-43 (Vermont has no home-state mapping) → an XS dataset
>    fix (**new QW11**); DH-44 (post-12A legislature-state vote count undecided) →
>    the 12A toggle (E4 / #93); DH-37 (no politician-to-politician trading) →
>    multiplayer / parking lot.
> 6. **★ NEGATIVE RESULT — do NOT scope an "Era of the Future."** No thread in the
>    corpus reaches a post-Gilded/post-modern era (`tea1772` "…to future" stalls at
>    1874 mid-Gilded; `hd`/`drums`/`pop` top out at Gilded/Progressive/Populism).
>    The future era is undocumented everywhere — **there is no build target. K4
>    adds EXACTLY `gilded` + `progressive`** (see the explicit guard at K4 + the
>    parking-lot note).
> 7. **META justification (cite, don't queue):** **DH-36 — GM burnout from manual
>    bookkeeping ABANDONED a 12-turn multiplayer 1772 game** (`new1772` POST 3607).
>    The **single strongest "why build AMPU at all" datum** in the corpus: the
>    computer must own the deterministic upkeep a human GM cannot sustain. It is
>    **not a row** — it is the motivation behind the whole build (esp. the scaling
>    walls E7/E8 + the CPU handler suite E9). Noted in the intro rationale below.
>
> **What changed vs. the batch-6 roadmap** (all from §9.6 + §9.1.5 + §9.1.6 +
> §9.1.7 + §9.3, binding):
> 1. **★ ERA-MODEL REFRAME re-specs K3 + K4 — NOT a new keystone (§9.1.5 /
>    divergence #18).** The biggest architectural reframe across all 7 batches.
>    K3's `advanceEra(snap, target)` becomes **`advanceEra(snap)`** — no `target`
>    arg; it watches an `era.advanceWhen(snap)` **game-state / meter / TERRITORY**
>    condition evaluated **per half-term** (the hard-coded `currentEra =
>    'federalism'` at `constitutionalConvention.ts:198` becomes the first such
>    condition). `year % 4` / `year % 2` stay as **phase CADENCE only**
>    (`phases.ts:49-59`, correct, keep). K4 gains the **per-era CONTENT-BAND
>    registry** `{bills, eraEvents, draftees, biasTable, advanceWhen}`; content
>    gates on `game.eraBand` + a **new `territoryOwned` predicate**, NOT the
>    calendar (un-owned-land bills/events/draftees are invalid — the mechanism
>    that *forces* `rep1800`'s ~30-yr content lag). The early sub-bands
>    (Republicanism / Democracy / Manifest-Destiny) are **content-band MARKERS,
>    not new enum values** (open Q; tech-lead's call: markers first). **RECONCILES
>    #68 point-banking + §26 BootSheet + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE era
>    system.** Both K3 + K4 stay **M**. K3 + K4 row descriptions UPDATED.
> 2. **★★ RECONSTRUCTION SOLO-BLOCKER (DH-29) = a hard DoD requirement on E3b
>    (§9.1.6).** GM-verified (`rep1800` POST 9170): the Strict/Ironclad-Oath
>    readmission plan can **NEVER pass with CPU factions** → solo Reconstruction
>    is UNWINNABLE, and AMPU is single-player. The 1856-arc epic's whole value is
>    *completing* the shipped 1856 scenario — so an unwinnable Reconstruction
>    means E3b ships an unwinnable scenario. **E3b's definition-of-done MUST
>    include a CPU-passable readmission path** — a CPU default-vote bias for the
>    flagged historical plan (via E9 handler #2 / a "historical-plan" flag
>    consulted *before* the §25.6 heuristic) **+** an era-boundary auto-resolution
>    backstop (via K3's condition-driven `advanceEra`). The readmission half of
>    E3b lands **after E9 handler #2** or carries the era-boundary auto-resolution
>    as its self-contained fallback. **Ties E3b to the CPU handler suite.** E3b
>    row UPDATED with the DoD requirement + the K5-handler-#2 dependency on the
>    readmission half.
> 3. **★ IDEOLOGY-AS-CIRCLE is FOUNDATIONAL — new Phase-1 #5b (§9.1.7 /
>    divergence #19).** `IDEOLOGY_ORDER` (`types.ts:14`) is LINEAR and distance is
>    **open-coded at 10+ sites** (`factionCenter` `phaseRunners.ts:715`,
>    `stepToward` `:740`, conversion adjacency `:993-1003`, sponsor `:3548`, a
>    private `firstContinentalCongress.ts:120` helper, + 3 UI pages) — **no
>    central helper exists**. Add a central `ideologyDistance(a, b, circular)`
>    helper + **migrate the 10+ sites to it** (behavior-preserving while the flag
>    is off) + gate the wrap on `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?`. **Place EARLY
>    (Phase-1 #5b)** — cheap/additive while off, and every later ideology consumer
>    (the conversion handler 9f, the SCOTUS within-1-step auto-AYE §26.6) calls it
>    from day one rather than open-coding distance an 11th/12th time. NEW row.
>    Not a keystone; M total (XS-S helper + migration; M for the flag +
>    conversion-adjacency).
> 4. **New early-republic subsystems fold into Phase-1 #4/#4b + the federalism
>    epic E1 (§9.6 note).** 12A legislature-elector toggle (#93 — a NEW
>    legislature-majority resolution branch; `senatePre17` does NOT model this;
>    extends the per-state EC #5/E4); slavery-flag + Cohens (#94 — **SMALLER than
>    assumed: `State.isSlaveState` ALREADY EXISTS at `types.ts:1329`**, so just
>    the abolition-toggle-off + the persistent `Cohens` SCOTUS rule-modifier);
>    Second Bank recharter clock + Bank War exec-action (#95 — ties K2 + the
>    dynamic seat list #89); statehood-by-bill ORGANIZE→ADMIT two-step +
>    unorganized-territory draft-gate (#95 — uses the SAME `territoryOwned`
>    predicate as the era reframe). E1 + E21 rows UPDATED; new E4b row.
> 5. **Design holes classified.** Era-events-predating-start is **MERGED into
>    BUG-1** (QW1 — `rep1800` LIVE-confirms it via the LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-
>    start episode, a 2nd same-class instance); **DH-30 event-scheduler-min-floor
>    added as a quick-win (QW10)** — its companion on the same scheduling surface
>    (min = 20% of the era's max, round down; spill to the 5 generic anytime
>    events). **DH-31** procedure-bill veto-misroute → fixed in the bill-typing
>    epic (E2 / divergence #21). **DH-32** SCOTUS-voids-a-STATE → a one-rule guard
>    in the SCOTUS docket (E25). **DH-33** impeachment-rules-broken → parking lot
>    (author-before-build, folds into E29). **DH-34** static-era-biases → a roadmap
>    DECISION (tech-lead's call: **ship static**, the forum's own stance). **DH-35**
>    thin-early-era agency → era-gate the action libraries (E11/E13/E24).
> 6. **`scenario1800`** = an optional later `BootSheet` instance (Phase 2, low
>    priority — `scenario1788` + `scenario1856` already cover the
>    federalism→nationalism band). Noted at E30/E31.
>
> **Carried from the batch-6 roadmap** (all from §9.6 + §9.1.4 + §9.3, binding):
> 1. **K4's `BootSheet` schema is THE cross-cutting batch-6 build constraint.**
>    Three documented mid-government boots — 1788 (designed) / 1856 (shipped) /
>    2012 (designed in `pop`) — share ONE shape: pre-built faction roster
>    (5 Blue + 5 Red) + per-faction archetype politicians + era-tuned
>    ideology/interest/lobby decks + sitting government keyed to start year +
>    **state roster keyed to `{era, startYear}`, NOT era alone** (divergence #17
>    — same `modern` enum has BOTH the 50+DC fresh-boot roster AND the 53-state
>    Wyoming-Rule continuation roster) + EXPLICITLY EMPTY at boot (no faction
>    leaders, no career-track pols, no inherited PV/legacy/Kingmaker pairs).
>    **Build the schema ONCE in K4**, instantiate per era. Era identity is
>    **data configuration**, not a code path. Plus **Senate-class verifier
>    (DH-24)** + **`TRAIT_CONFLICTS` validator (DH-27)** at the boot pipeline
>    (the two new XS validators below).
> 2. **APOCALYPSE meter-driven endgame folds into Phase-1 #6 (meter-model
>    generalization), sized M.** Verified shipped: only event-driven endgame
>    exists (`EraEvent.triggersGameEnd` → `phaseRunners.ts:2871` →
>    `game.gameEnded`); no meter-watcher, no countdown clock anywhere. The
>    forum adds a NEW model (`pop` POST 542, 548): bottom-tier band entry →
>    10-game-year countdown → mandatory game-end (recovery clears it). The
>    `planet` meter ships and ticks every era; the `game.gameEnded` sink is
>    shared with the event-driven path — both close cleanly through the same
>    sink. Folds into Phase-1 #6 (same code area `runPhase_2_5_1_Lingering`,
>    same termination sink). New `GameState.endgameClocks: { meter; threshold;
>    remainingYears; startedYear }[]` field + arm/decrement/terminate path.
>    **NOT Phase-2** — the model is meter-agnostic; the Populism Planet Health
>    clock is one configured row in a per-era table.
> 3. **K2 gains `requires?: AmendmentPredicate` from day one** (divergence
>    #16). One extra field on the `GameAction<Ctx>` shape + one filter step in
>    the picker reading `game.amendments.passed`. Cheap if early, expensive if
>    retrofit across 6 libraries. Canonical instance: the general-election
>    action "Send VP to Shore Up Support" requires the 12th Amendment. Same
>    `requires:` mechanism gates bill catalog entries (income-tax category) +
>    gov action rows — predicate field belongs at the registry-row level.
> 4. **E16 cabinet refactor absorbs the dynamic seat list** (divergence #15).
>    Verified: `cabinetSeatsForYear` (`types.ts:1196`) is pure derived with NO
>    mutable state today; `phaseRunners.ts:2162` recomputes it each turn.
>    Refactor: shipped function becomes the **boot seed only**; runners read
>    `GameState.cabinetSeats: SeatSpec[]`; bill-sign handler appends
>    `Legislation.createsCabinetSeat?: SeatSpec`. Folds into E16 (same code
>    area as cabinet retention, marginal additional cost). Pairs with #66
>    (Progressive institutional layer).
> 5. **Modern era epic SPLITS into TWO scenarios** (Phase 2). `scenario1948`
>    continuation (the 60-yr `modern` digest play-through that produces the
>    53-state Wyoming-Rule roster) AND `scenario2012` fresh-modern boot (the
>    canonical `BootSheet` instantiation — 10 pre-built faction decks
>    [R1=Trumpism, B1=Bernie-populism, etc.] + Obama/Biden + 9-named SCOTUS +
>    50+DC roster, EXPLICITLY EMPTY at boot). Both depend on K4's `BootSheet`
>    schema + DH-25 (career-track bootstrap) resolved. State roster fork:
>    `scenario1948` → 53-state Wyoming + 2-home-state pols; `scenario2012` →
>    50+DC.
> 6. **CPU handler #2 (legislation) and handler #4 (cabinet) consume the
>    conditional-vote-rules primitive** (`pop` POST 1111). Iron-Fist
>    controllers publish declarative `Predicate → {AYE/NAY}` policies stored
>    at `Faction.factionLeader.compelledVoteRule?`. Handler #2 consults this
>    BEFORE the §25.6 NAY/AYE heuristic; handler #4 consumes the same primitive
>    for auto-AYE-own-picks AND SCOTUS within-1-step auto-AYE (§26.6.1).
>    Promotes a §25.9 sub-effect to a first-class CPU primitive. Folds into E17
>    (Iron-Fist split) + the CPU handler suite (E9 handlers #2, #4).
> 7. **Two new XS quick-win validators (QW8 + QW9)** for boot-pipeline data
>    quality: **QW8 Senate-class verifier (DH-24)** + **QW9 `TRAIT_CONFLICTS`
>    validator at boot/dataset import (DH-27)**. Both land at K4's boot
>    pipeline; both are XS one-validator helpers.
> 8. **DH-25 (career-track bootstrap unresolved) is the biggest new parking-lot
>    item — it BLOCKS modern scenario shipping.** 3-year-stale design discussion
>    has no canonical rule for which existing pols start on career tracks at a
>    mid-game boot. Author the rule (Zagnut's "1996+, 1/track" houserule is on
>    the table) before `scenario1948` or `scenario2012` ships (Phase-2 #30/#31).
> 9. **DH-26 3rd-party VP-trait "prohibitive" folds into E26** (third-party
>    trigger) alongside DH-11's Dem-3rd-party bias. **DH-28 climate-meter-tag
>    completeness** folds into the dataset pipeline (a CI/dataset-time validator
>    at the existing `scripts/` regeneration step).

## Now shipped (history)

Reverse-chronological. The expertise/abilities/traits/cabinet/lobby epic (PR1–7)
is complete; the knowledge-base infra and eight ingestion batches are knowledge
milestones (no code, but they are what every item below is traced to).

- **Batch-8 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed the **two 1772 threads**:
  **`new1772`** (the **first MULTIPLAYER 1772 founding campaign** — 10 humans
  1772→1796, the only thread that stands up the entire federal apparatus
  piece-by-piece from a 1772 start; **abandoned at GM burnout**) + **`tea1772`**
  (a 157-post **solo all-CPU 1772→1874 fast-traversal** that stalls mid-Gilded —
  "Stamping out America's love for tea"). The headline value is **confidence, not
  new scope**: this batch makes the era-model the **single most-corroborated
  architectural finding in the KB — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN** (two independent saves,
  1772-start `tea1772` + 1800-start `rep1800`, 28 in-game years apart, emit the
  **identical era-band labels at the same in-game dates** — game-context #102).
  Gap log gained rows **#100–#105** (SCOTUS-overturns-a-ratified-Amendment +
  threshold-amendable; the multi-save era-band proof; dual era-scoring [per-era +
  cumulative] as the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard; presidential-vote modifier stack +
  era-issue list; lone-ideology convention exploit; stat-collapse → forced
  presidential resignation) + nine design holes **DH-36..DH-44** (GM-burnout META;
  no pol-trading; late-ratification/Rogue-Island window; all-human Convention
  deadlock; SCOTUS-justice-count-not-auto-packaged → game-stall; ★ the general
  SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade [UNBUILT, `vcczar`-deferred];
  national-meters swamp per-state lean; Vermont no-home-state; post-12A
  legislature vote-count). `technical-guide.md` §9 hardened (NO re-sequence): **★
  K3/K4 bumped to HIGHEST confidence** (§9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump — multi-save
  proven); **★ E16's dynamic-seat refactor justification strengthened** (the WRONG
  model confirmed founding→modern); **★ DH-41 added to the author-before-build
  parking lot** (now 10); **#100/#103/#104/#105 + DH-38/39/40/42/43/44 folded into
  their epics**; **DH-43 added as QW11** (Vermont dataset fix); **DH-36 cited as
  the META justification** + **★ the no-future-era NEGATIVE-RESULT guard added**.
  _Complete._
- **Batch-7 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed `rep1800` (the "Era of
  Republicanism" 1800→1868 early-republic campaign — the **first procedural
  record of the 1800–1856 early republic**, Jeffersonian → Era-of-Good-Feelings →
  Jacksonian → Manifest-Destiny → Nationalism → 1868; the **predecessor of
  batch-1's `gilded`**, so **the 1800 campaign is now documented end-to-end**).
  The headline value is an **architecture reframe** — eras are content-bands
  gated by game-state + territory ownership, NOT the calendar. Gap log gained
  rows #92 (★ eras-as-content-bands), #93–#98 (12A before/after state machine;
  slavery-as-state-flag + Cohens-v-Virginia amendment-only abolition; Second
  Bank recharter clock + Bank War; 20-state Call-for-Convention crisis;
  Civil-War VARIANTS [Pres-defects-to-CSA / Hartford / Northern / UK-intervention
  / guerrilla]; coup-at-low-meters meters-driven game-over set) + #99

### Quick-wins — land immediately (XS each, high feel-value)

Fixes + cheap divergence/balance resolutions. **BUG-0 is at the very top — the
cheapest win in the roadmap.** **BUG-1 is the exception that matters:** it is XS
but a **hard gate on the federalism epic** — land it *in or just before* E1.
**Batch 7: BUG-1 now ALSO subsumes the era-events-predating-start-DROPPED hole**
(LIVE-confirmed by `rep1800`'s LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-start episode — a 2nd
same-class instance; same bug, merged). **QW10 (DH-30 event-scheduler-min-floor)
is BUG-1's companion** on the same scheduling surface. DH-2 (modern deck fired
off-year cards) is the **same scheduling surface** as BUG-1 + divergence #4 and is
investigated at E15, not as its own quick-win.

| # | Item | Scope | Depends on | Size | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QW0 | **BUG-0 — relocation cap `5`→`4` (divergence #9)** *(do FIRST)* | **One-line const edit:** `RELOCATION_ATTEMPTS_PER_TURN = 4` at `types.ts:247` (shipped value is `5`). The designer changed it to 4 mid-thread and it went **live in the running playtest**; the browser engine never caught up. **Settled value, no migration** (a tunable const, not a save field), no dependency. The auto-Carpetbagger + 10-yr-expiry + alt-state-exemption *feature* is QW4 / E17 — this row is **only** the stale constant. **The cheapest win in the whole roadmap.** | — | XS | bug BUG-0 / divergence #9 (`hd` §0/I-1, 7062-7066, 7555) + codebase (`types.ts:247`) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW1 | **BUG-1 — era-event era-lock filter (now ALSO subsumes era-events-predating-start-DROPPED, batch 7)** *(federalism gate)* | Add an era-vs-start-year filter to `buildEraEventsForYear` (`phaseRunners.ts:2817`): an event whose era is past the scenario's start era is treated as already-happened and excluded from the roll table — **BUT** the official ruling (`fed` POST 524) also means a start year *past* an era wrongly **loses** that era's still-pending content (an **1800-start game wrongly loses the Louisiana Purchase**). **Batch 7 LIVE-CONFIRMS this exact bug:** `rep1800` §A POST 2668 — the GM found the LA Purchase was filed under the prior Era of Federalism and "not included" for an 1800-start game; he hand-added it in 1816. Same bug, **merged** (the era-events-predating-start-DROPPED hole is the same defect, not a new row). Latent today; **a blocker the moment a 3rd scenario (1788/1800) ships** — so this rides with E1. **Resolve together with QW10 (DH-30 min-floor) + DH-2 + divergence #4** (one scheduling surface, at E15). | — | XS | bug BUG-1 (`fed` 521-535; **`rep1800` §A 2668 LIVE-confirms**), DH-2 (`modern` 2221) — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF (2 era) | ready |
| QW2 | **BUG-3 — no-PM-General fallback guard** | Defensive guard on the `GeneralInChief` fill path (`phaseRunners.ts:2255`): empty-pool ⇒ leave vacant + log (or auto-generate a stopgap officer — ties to E8 procedural pol gen). Closes a potential crash. | — | XS | bug BUG-3 (`fed` 5, 119) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW3 | **±3-per-phase meter-swing clamp (meter-model divergence; now confirmed live by `drums` #80)** | One-helper change: clamp every `NationalMeters` write to ±3 per phase (`types.ts:1399`). **Batch 5 extends this:** apply the same clamp to **cabinet ideology net-swings** and **per-phase ideology swings** at the same chokepoint (#80, `drums` POST 4574 — a live designer patch). Orthogonal to the full named-ordinal relabel (parked) and to E6's crisis/cascade rules (which build on it). Cheap balance/feel win. | — | XS | meter model §21.8/§22.1/§22.2 (`1772s`; `modern`; **`drums` #80 POST 4574**) — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF | ready |
| QW4 | **Auto-Carpetbagger on alt-state moves (divergence #2)** | Replace the 4-step probability ladder with auto-grant on a successful alt-state relocation; add 10-year expiry + exempt alt-state moves from the relocation cap (now 4/half-term after QW0). More legible; removes a dead dial. | QW0 (the cap value) | XS | gap #38, divergence #2 (`gilded` 36; `1772s` 3-52; `modern` 147; `hd` I-1; **`drums` POSTS 2627, 2630-2634, 2755, 7465 add the per-roll % table + recent-state filter**) — HI-CONF (5 era) | ready |
| QW5 | **DH-3 — bar career-track pols from the presidency** | Add a guard at presidential-candidate eligibility (and CPU presidential selection) so career-track pols can't run — closing a GM-acknowledged rules gap (career-track is already barred from Gov/Rep/leadership/Kingmaker). Relates to the primary (E22) but is a cheap standalone guard now. | — | XS | DH-3 (`hd` 8205-8219; relates to #63) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW6 | **DH-5 — Kingmaker-pairing dissolution on flip** | A rule in the conversion path: converting/flipping a Kingmaker no longer seizes his protégés (or their +1 election standing) — flagged "insanely OP." Same code area as Reconstruction amnesty (E3b prunes broken Kingmaker pairs). Cheap balance fix on shipped Kingmaker/conversion machinery (`KINGMAKER_RULES` `types.ts:295`, `CONVERSION_ODDS` `:268`). | — | XS–S | DH-5 (`hd` 7589, 8762; relates to #29/#30) — CARRIED | ready |
| **QW7** | **#85 — 5%/half-term retire/death + mandatory military-officer retire at 75** *(batch 5)* | A 1-line refinement of `MORTALITY_RULES` per-era table (`types.ts:485`): per-half-term **5% retirement/death roll for senators + cabinet** + mandatory **military-officer retire at 75** + ~10% baseline cabinet-decline roll. Tyler patched this mid-run (POST 5437) to solve CPU stagnation in long campaigns. **Pure tunable; no shape change; cheap.** | — | XS | #85 (`drums` 2493, 5437, 6469) — CARRIED | ready |
| **QW8** | **DH-24 — Senate-class verifier at K4 boot pipeline** *(NEW, batch 6)* | A one-helper `validateSenateClasses(snap)` that, at scenario-boot time AND at `loadStandardDraftClasses` (`standardDraftClasses.ts:13`), checks each sitting senator's last-election year against their assigned Senate class (I/II/III) and flags mismatches. `pop` POST 272/297/298: a fresh modern boot's seed data had Ron Johnson (WI) up in 2010 instead of 2012; GM had to swap classes mid-election. **One pure validator helper, run at K4's boot pipeline.** Lands at the K4 boot pipeline (does NOT require K4 to be fully built — can ship as a standalone helper now, then wire into the boot pipeline when K4 lands). | — (helper); wires into K4 boot pipeline when K4 lands | XS | DH-24 (`pop` 272, 297, 298) — NEW | ready |
| **QW9** | **DH-27 — `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` validator at dataset/boot import** *(NEW, batch 6)* | A one-helper `validateTraitConflicts(snap, dataset)` that runs `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` (`types.ts:658`) against `snap.politicians[]` at scenario-boot AND against the loaded dataset at `loadStandardDraftClasses` (`standardDraftClasses.ts:13`). Today `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` is consulted only on **trait-ADD events**, not on dataset/boot import — so boot/seed data can ship a pol with both `Integrity` AND `Controversial` (`pop` POST 1139: Quinn). **One pure validator helper.** Same pattern as QW8 — can ship now as a standalone helper, then wire into K4's boot pipeline. | — (helper); wires into K4 boot pipeline when K4 lands | XS | DH-27 (`pop` 1139; `types.ts:658`) — NEW | ready |
| **QW10** | **DH-30 — event-scheduler MIN floor (+ spill-to-anytime)** *(NEW, batch 7 — BUG-1's companion)* | The era-event scheduler has a **MAX per half-term but no MIN floor** — over a 20-yr era a 25%-event ≈94% cumulative, but a low-% era can fire *zero* events some playthroughs. `rep1800` POST 2918-2932: *"the limit is a max not a min… which isn't what we discussed."* **Agreed fix: minimum = 20% of the era's max (round down)**; if still none fire (all prereq-gated), **spill to the current 5 generic anytime events**. (A rejected alt — hard year-windows per event — was declined because *"events not happening every playthrough has been explicitly stated to be how the game operates"*, load-bearing for alt-history.) **Same scheduling surface as BUG-1 + divergence #4** — land it alongside QW1 / at E15. Small, additive; no new save shape. | — (pairs with QW1; full scheduling fork resolved at E15) | XS | DH-30 (`rep1800` §A 2918, 2919-2932; companion to BUG-1) — NEW | ready |
| **QW11** | **DH-43 — Vermont home-state mapping (dataset/data fix)** *(NEW, batch 8)* | Vermont-origin pols have **no home-state mapping**, so they cannot relocate "home" (`new1772`). **A pure dataset/data fix:** ensure VT's `homeStates`/region wiring exists (VT enters via the expansion path — `expansionStates.ts` / the statehood pipeline) so VT-origin pols resolve a home state for the relocation/Carpetbagger readers. No engine logic, no save shape — a one-row data correction. Smallest of the batch-8 placements; independent of everything. | — | XS | DH-43 (`new1772`; relates to relocation/Carpetbagger) — NEW | ready |

### Engine track — Phase 0 (keystones)

**`K0 → (K1 ‖ K2 ‖ K3) → K4 ‖ K5`.** After K0, K1/K2/K3 are independent and
parallelizable across PRs; K4 depends on K3. **K5 is a new late-keystone (batch
5)** — sits after K0 + K2, parallel with K3/K4 + federalism (§9.1.3). K2 remains
the single most important keystone (~6× leverage) — **do it first if only one
lands**, because K5 depends on it (most handlers pick from a registry).
**Batch-4: per-era point BANKING (#68) is folded into K3/K4 — not a new item.**
**★ Batch-7: the era-model reframe RE-SPECS K3 + K4 — NOT a new keystone** (§9.1.5
/ divergence #18). `advanceEra` becomes condition-driven (game-state / meter /
TERRITORY, per half-term — no `target` arg); content gates on `game.eraBand` + a
new `territoryOwned` predicate, not the calendar; early sub-bands are content-band
markers. **No new keystones this batch.** See the updated K3 + K4 rows.
**★★ Batch-8: K3 + K4 are now MULTI-SAVE PROVEN — the HIGHEST-confidence large bet
in the roadmap** (§9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump). Two independent saves —
`tea1772` (1772-start) and `rep1800` (1800-start, 28 in-game years apart) — emit
the **identical era-band sequence at identical in-game dates** (game-context #102),
so the content-band model is **settled, not speculative**. **Nothing structural
changes** (the K3/K4 spec was already condition-driven from batch 7); this is a
**confidence/priority raise only** — if engine staffing is scarce, K3/K4 are the
safest era investment to start. **#102's dual era-scoring (per-era winner +
cumulative "winner so far") is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard** — it folds into
K3/K4's per-era point-banking (#68 banks the cumulative total; the win condition is
**DUAL**), NOT a new item. **No new keystones this batch either.**

| # | Item | Scope | Depends on | Size | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| K0 | **Seed the RNG** | Drop a real PRNG (mulberry32/xoshiro) into `rng.ts:5`; store `seed` + state on `GameState` (optional + `repair()` backfill); migrate the **14** raw `Math.random` engine calls (election jitter `phaseRunners.ts:3711`, generic-war `:3603`, draft fallback `:188-198`, `revolutionaryWar.ts:89,97`, `continentalCongress.ts:271`). Keep wrapper signatures. | — | S–M | debt #1–#3 (determinism prereq for multiplayer + replay + **K5 deterministic tie-breaks**) — CARRIED | ready |
| K1 | **`State.policies` + `State.electionMethod` data shapes** | Two additive `State` fields (`types.ts:1318`): `policies?: Partial<Record<StatePolicyId, StatePolicy>>` (Poll Tax/Jim Crow/Prohibition/Women's Suffrage/Segregation; `multiplierUntilYear`) + `electionMethod?: 'popular'\|'legislature'`. `repair()` backfill `{}` / `'popular'`. Extend `Predicate` with `{ statePolicyActive }` + `{ electionMethodIs }`. **Reads from the K5 governor handler (DH-19 / handler 9j) to prune no-op actions.** | K0 | XS | gap #21 (`gilded` 125; `modern` 25-2245; **`drums`** confirms) + #44 (`fed` 194-373) — CARRIED, HI-CONF | ready |
| K2 | **`ActionRegistry<Ctx>` keystone + `requires?: AmendmentPredicate` from day one (batch 6 / divergence #16)** | Define `GameAction<Ctx>` + `ActionRegistry<Ctx>` once in `src/engine/actionRegistry.ts` (one ~80-line type covering id/label/`isAvailable`/`resolve`/`persistence`) + one UI Action Picker + one JSON-serializable persistence shape. Used by **six+** action libraries (governor/exec/diplomacy/convention-inter-ballot/primary/general — plus the Reconstruction readmission-plan + secession-trigger rows at E3b). **~6× tax if built ad-hoc — the highest-leverage keystone.** **Hard prerequisite for K5** — most CPU handlers pick from a registry library. **Batch 6: the `GameAction<Ctx>` shape gains a `requires?: AmendmentPredicate` field from day one** (divergence #16). One extra field + one filter step in the picker reading `game.amendments.passed`. Canonical instance: the general-election action "Send VP to Shore Up Support" requires the 12th Amendment. Same `requires:` mechanism gates bill catalog entries (income-tax category) + gov action rows; predicate lives at the registry-row level, not the library level. **Cheap if early, expensive if retrofit** across 6 libraries. **Resolve DH-9 (canonical action ability-stat) before the `resolve` signatures harden.** | K0 | S | §6.6 (now confirmed **5 eras**; `hd` adds the Reconstruction/exec rows; `drums` raises the consumer count to 6+; **`pop` POST 951 adds `requires?` field for divergence #16**) + DH-9 — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF (5 era) | ready |
| K3 | **`advanceEra(snap)` — CONDITION-DRIVEN (batch 7, ★ re-specced) — + era-content registry + content-band gating + per-era point BANKING (#68)** | Replace the hard-coded `currentEra = 'federalism'` in `constitutionalConvention.ts:198` with a pure callable transition. **★ Batch-7 reframe (the key change vs. the prior K3 spec): the era boundary is GAME-STATE / METER / TERRITORY-driven, evaluated PER HALF-TERM — NOT a year boundary** (§9.1.5 / divergence #18). `advanceEra` takes **no `target` arg** — it watches an `era.advanceWhen(snap)` condition (the early-republic bands advance on game-state + territory ownership; the Constitution-ratifies trigger at `:198` becomes the **first such condition**, not a hard-coded line). Verified: phases gate by `year % 4` / `year % 2` (`phases.ts:49-59`) — those are **correct for CADENCE and STAY**; there is **no year→era derivation anywhere** (`currentEra` is a plain field), so this is a **generalization of the one existing trigger, not a rewrite**. **★ Gate all content (bills / era-events / draftees / bias-table) on `game.eraBand` + a NEW `territoryOwned` predicate, NOT literal year** — un-owned-land content is invalid (Louisiana-born pols un-playable until LA is owned; this is the mechanism that *forces* `rep1800`'s ~30-yr content lag). **One new `territoryOwned(snap, requirement)` predicate** (a `Predicate` variant + one `evalPredicate` case at `eraGraph.ts:12`), **three consumers** (bill catalog, era-event walker, draft pool — the draft pool also excludes pols whose state/territory is un-owned/unorganized, = §27.5's gate). **The bank-and-zero boot pipeline (#68) fires AT the content-band boundary wherever it lands on the calendar:** bank the running per-era `Faction.score` into `eraPointBanks?: Record<Era,…>` + zero the running total, pay end-of-era awards, re-run pre-turn phases (2.1.x→2.3.1), swap content pools (card-pool + per-era card-count rescale, draft profile, SCOTUS set, nation renames, party-formation, **per-era state-bias table wholesale**). The per-era banks **sum toward the (open) cross-era win total**. Lift the **5** `ERA_GRAPH_1772` spots in `eraGraph.ts` (`:4,:73,:113,:148,:164`) to `ERA_GRAPHS: Record<Era, GraphNode[]>`. **No new top-level field beyond an optional `game.eraBand` marker (can reuse `currentEra`).** **RECONCILES #68 point-banking + §26 BootSheet boot model + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE era system** (debt #5/#9 dissolve here). **★ Batch-8 — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN (HIGHEST confidence, no scope change):** the content-band sequence is corroborated by TWO independent saves (`tea1772` 1772-start + `rep1800` 1800-start, 28 in-game years apart, identical bands at identical dates — #102), so the condition-driven model is settled, not speculative. **The per-era banks feed the DUAL win-condition scoreboard (#102): a per-era winner AND a cumulative "winner so far"** — the bank-and-zero already computes both (the running total is the cumulative scoreboard), so this is a labeling/exposure concern, NOT new banking logic. | K0 | M | gap #2 (`fed` 11,518; `modern` 1080,1172; `hd` I-12, 6679-6816) + **#92 (`rep1800` §B 4329, 5082, 5255-5256, 5602, 5828-5837; §A open-Q 1)** + **#102 multi-save proof + dual-scoring (`tea1772` 21/62/91/130/153 + `rep1800` 92/6201)** + #68 (banking) + divergence #18, debt #5/#9 — CARRIED + RE-SPECCED, **MULTI-SAVE PROVEN, HIGHEST-CONF (2 independent saves / 6 era)** | ready |

### Engine track — Phase 1 (subsystems, dependency-ordered)

Ordered exactly per tech-lead §9.6 to minimize rework. The federalism /
early-republic epic (E1) is one spine; **E3b (Civil War / Reconstruction) is the
second — it completes the already-shipped 1856 scenario** and sits right after
generic war (E3) + K2, **not** behind federalism or the modern tail (§9.1.2).
**Batch-7 additions: E4 folds in the 12A legislature-elector toggle; new E4b is
the early-republic cluster** (slavery-flag+Cohens / Second Bank+Bank War /
statehood-by-bill+territory-gate); **new E5b (ideology-as-circle) is the
foundational central-helper refactor placed early** (§9.1.7). Rows **E6–E8** are
the **NEAR-TERM cross-cutting items the modern thread pulled forward** — not
modern-only. **E9 is the CPU handler suite — 15 lightweight PRs once K5 lands;
★★ E9 handler #2 is the gate on E3b's Reconstruction readmission half (DH-29).**
**Batch-8 fold-ins (no new rows, no re-order):** **#100** SCOTUS-overturns-an-
amendment + amendable-threshold → E5 (amendments) + E25 (SCOTUS docket); **#103**
presidential-vote modifier stack + era-issue list + **DH-42** meter-vs-lean balance
→ E20 (election-math/scoring); **#104** lone-ideology convention exploit → E9
handler 9e (guard); **#105** stat-collapse → forced resignation → E10b
(succession); **DH-38** late-ratification/"Rogue Island" window → E1; **DH-40**
SCOTUS-justice-count-not-packaged → game-STALL → E14b (packaging) + E25
(SCOTUS-establish guard), XS-S; **DH-44** post-12A legislature vote-count → E4 (the
12A toggle); **DH-39** all-human Convention deadlock + **DH-37** no pol-trading →
multiplayer/parking lot.

> Almost all of P0–P4 are **read-only views over snapshot data that already
> exists** — independent of the keystones/engine subsystems. Sync points are a
> handful of small additive `Politician`/`Party` fields + **two deeper handoffs**:
> A4 (battle-card) wires real numbers when **E3 (generic war)** lands, and **P2
> (portraits) shares the demographic model with E8 (procedural pol generation)** —
> P2 must render *generated* pols. **Hard constraint, encode from day one: no
> AI-generated imagery or text in the shipped product.** **A9 is NOT on this track**

## Later / parking lot

Bigger, fuzzier, deferred, or **needs-design-before-build**.

### Author-before-build (design tasks — a PM/design job, not a `/build-feature` run)

These have **no rules to build to yet**; the rules must be **authored first**, then
they fold into the engine row noted. **Batch 8 adds ONE NEW author-before-build
item:** **DH-41** — the general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade (UNBUILT,
`vcczar`-deferred; folds into the SCOTUS docket E25 once decided). **Batch 7 added
ONE:** DH-33 impeachment-ruleset rewrite (folds into E29) — plus a separate
**roadmap DECISION** (DH-34 static-era-biases — *resolved: ship static*; see the
note below, it is **not** an author task). **Batch 6 added ONE BLOCKER:** DH-25
career-track bootstrap (3-yr-stale design discussion; **BLOCKS Phase-2 modern
scenarios E30 + E31**). **Batch 5 added six items:** contingent-election rules
(#10/#84 is the biggest), §25.9 Iron-Fist split, DH-12 white-peace, DH-13
faithless-elector cap, DH-14 era-aware bill ideology, DH-15 small-state action
multiplier. **Total author-before-build items now: 10** (DH-1, #10/#84, §25.9,
DH-12, DH-13, DH-14, DH-15, DH-25, DH-33, **DH-41**).

- **DH-1 — filibustered "MUST-pass" bill remedy (needs-design).** A required
  bill filibustered to death has no rulebook remedy; the GM improvised a
  4-leader special-committee auto-pass with a per-day "shutdown" penalty clock.
  **Author the deadlock-resolution rule** (forced-compromise vs shutdown-clock
  vs fallback auto-pass), then build into **E14c (filibuster) / E29**. — DH-1,
  debt #21 (`modern` 640-716).
- **Divergence #10 / #84 — Contingent-election rules don't exist (NEW, batch 5).**
  GM Tyler invented **5 candidate rulesets** to settle 1848 tie (`drums` POSTS
  472-474): party-line state vote / faction-first then party / Speaker-Min-
  Leader-controls-state / momentum+swaying / state modifiers. All 5 favored
  Fillmore; GM picked #4 (momentum) to keep play moving. **Author rules
  BEFORE build:** (a) top-2 vs top-3 (DH-6: GM used top-2); (b) outgoing-vs-
  incoming Congress (GM nebulous, used incoming POSTS 4467-4475); (c) deadlock
  side-effects (EBR POST 5250: Controversial gain on elected Pres + 50/50 Dom
  Stab hit); plus 17 state delegations for Pres + 33 Senate for VP (POST 810).
  **Bundles with hd #62 at E10b.** — #10/#84/DH-6 (`drums` 472-474, 810,
  4467-4475, 5176, 5217-5221, 5250).
- **§25.9 — Iron-Fist exact split shape (NEW, batch 5).** The 6 office-keyed
  child trait names + cascade rules need a designer call before build. §25.9
  lists 6 candidate effects (PL+Honest-Gov-maxed gov control; Sen Maj Leader
  vote forcing; President officer-fire / SCOTUS-compel / challenger-stifle;
  Loans-from-Wealthy + IF PL gov takeover; Convention PL unilateral threshold;
  mid-war military replacement) but the **exact names** and **what cascades to
  what** are open. Author the split, then build **E17**. — gap #77 + §25.9
  (`drums` 2433-7364).
- **DH-12 — White-peace rules MISSING from the war system (NEW, batch 5).**
  Tyler (`drums` POSTS 6533-6541): *"There are, in fact, no rules about white
  peace"* — had to dig up old treaty docs. **Author the spec** (Moderate
  Implementation Pres+Sec State+Sec War; 75% −1 Party Pref; −100 Mil-Industry;
  −500 Expansionists; −500 President; return to antebellum status quo), then
  fold into **E3** (generic war) / **E3b** (Civil-War readmission). — DH-12.
- **DH-13 — Faithless-elector trigger cap (NEW, batch 5).** Current trigger
  fires "whenever winner's state has the other party's ideology enthusiasm
  maxed" — over-aggressive (`drums` POSTS 466, 469-471, 2912, 4441): 1876
  produced 22 faithless from Cobb + 12 from Fremont; 1892 produced 8 Whig →
  232-232 tie → House contingent; 1900 had an 8-elector defection. **Author
  the documented + capped trigger** (e.g. max-N per state + state-modifier
  table) + the EBR deadlock side-effect rule (POST 5250). Folds into **E26**
  3rd-party or a per-(state) cap inside the EC tally. — DH-13.
- **DH-14 — Bill ideology impacts not era-aware (NEW, batch 5).** Matt
  (`drums` POSTS 6691, 6878, 6912): Mods need to be removed from the
  negative-points side of Women's Suffrage in 1916 — should be era-sensitive.
  Tyler agreed. **Equal Voting Rights for Women never passes** (60.5% / 63.6%
  short of 2/3): GM: *"This amendment will never pass in a game with CPUs."*
  **Author the era-keyed bill ideology impact tables**, then fold into the bill
  catalog (E14 / E20). — DH-14.
- **DH-15 — Small/large-state action-impact multiplier UNCODIFIED (batch 5).**
  Tyler (`drums` POSTS 6676-6680): *"Since RI is a small state he would only
  succeed on impacting the meter at 2.5% [half of 5%]; large states double."*
  In playtest sheets ("Effects Meters?" column) but **not codified in the gov
  actions section of the rulebook**. **Author the multiplier rule + the
  small/large-state classification table**, then fold into **E11** (governor
  actions). — DH-15.
- **DH-25 — Career-track bootstrap unresolved (NEW, batch 6 — BLOCKS Phase-2
  modern scenarios E30 + E31).** Lars (`pop` POST 33): *"we've legit been
  having this discussion for almost three years now and somehow we've yet to
  change the rulebook or the game."* For a mid-game boot, the question is
  "which existing pols start on career tracks (Foreign / Military /
  Industrial / Academic / Bureaucrat) at boot?" — and no canonical rule
  exists. **Zagnut's houserule on the table:** anyone drafted in 1996+ goes
  onto one track each (POST 31). Rodja hand-populated by GM ad-hoc (POST 38,
  50). **Author the bootstrap rule before `scenario1948` (E30) or
  `scenario2012` (E31) ships** — both are gated on it. **The single biggest
  parking-lot item from batch 6.** — DH-25.
- **DH-33 — Impeachment ruleset broken/outdated (NEW, batch 7).** The
  impeachment mini-flow runs but the canonical rules are flagged
  non-functional / improvised — `rep1800` corroborates `hd`'s "impeachment
  super outdated and doesn't work" across a **2nd campaign** (an Integrity
  justice got accused of bribery — nonsensical; only **resignation** avoids
  the DomStab/Honest-Gov drop). **Author the impeachment rewrite before
  building it into E29** (modern legislative depth). — DH-33 (`rep1800` §A
  465-474; §B 3594, 3620; corroborates `hd` DH-14-impeachment).
- **★ DH-41 — general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade (NEW, batch 8
  — the headline batch-8 author-before-build item).** `tea1772` POST 124-126: a
  spectator argued **Prigg v. Pennsylvania** should auto-void the Fugitive Slave
  Act; `vcczar` **deferred** — *"V will need to think about it."* This is
  **distinct from the *built* strike-a-single-law** (`tea1772` POST 770-784) **and
  from #100's overturn-an-amendment-on-review** — it is the **general cascade**: a
  ruling that *contradicts a law on the books*. **Today a contradicting ruling
  leaves the law operative.** A genuinely undesigned policy: does the ruling
  void/neuter the conflicting law, or leave it operative (the current default)?
  **Author the cascade policy before building it**, then fold into the SCOTUS
  docket (**E25**). Cross-refs §24.4's *Pollock*→income-tax coupling (which IS a
  designed gate, already handled at E5/E25). — DH-41 (`tea1772` 124-126; cf. the
  built 770-784).

### Roadmap decisions (a planner CALL, not an author task)

- **★ DH-34 — Static era-biases vs. policy-reactive biases → the Red-unwinnable
  "AMPU 2.0" hole (NEW, batch 7). DECISION: ship static biases.** The single
  most-repeated `rep1800` complaint: `State.bias` is a static per-era table that
  does **not** react to policy (abolish slavery → the South should swing Red, but
  doesn't), so the Federalists are acknowledged-**unwinnable 1800–1840** (Blue
  142-0 House by 1804; Jefferson 179-0 / 197-15) and players quit. The GM +
  designer's own stance: dynamic/policy-reactive biases are *"too complicated /
  not part of the AMPU vision… maybe AMPU 2.0."* **The planner must DECIDE: ship
  static (accept the imbalance — the cheap path the forum itself chose) vs. invest
  in policy-reactive biases (a large new system).** **Tech-lead's call, adopted
  here: SHIP STATIC for now** (it is the forum's own stance and the imbalance is a
  known-accepted property); revisit only if balance becomes a release blocker.
  **This means K4's per-era state-bias table swaps in wholesale at the boundary
  (#68 step 6) but does NOT react to policy.** Pairs with #21/#34 (bias as a
  field) + DH-29's solo-balance theme. — DH-34 (`rep1800` §A 22, 350, 720-747,
  1328-1335, 2444-2457, 2641, 2711-2713). **NOT an author-before-build item — it
  is resolved (ship static); no rules to write.**

### Balance dials (fold into the named subsystem; no standalone build)

- **DH-4** — cap "Extend Credit to all nations" → **E12** (diplomacy library).
- **DH-11** — apparent Dem 3rd-party bias → **E26**; inelastic lobby cards →
  **E19** (card algorithm).
- **DH-16** — reapportionment cap 435 likely never triggers in normal play
  (POST 5352: ~year 2000 before the cap binds). No fix needed; flag for the
  apportionment recompute (E28). — batch 5.
- **DH-26 — 3rd-party VP "same traits" rule is prohibitive (NEW, batch 6).**
  An independent presidential run requires *"a VP with the same traits"* as
  the presidential candidate (Lars `pop` POST 945-947), making 3rd-party
  tickets **nearly impossible** in practice. **Pairs with DH-11** (Dem
  3rd-party structural bias). Both 3rd-party design holes are addressed
  simultaneously inside **E26** (third-party trigger): relax the trait
  constraint AND fix the structural bias. → **E26**.
- **DH-28 — "Repeal climate crisis" tag completeness is gameable (NEW,
  batch 6).** Only some Repeal bills carry the "deals with climate crisis"
  tag (`pop` POST 552); players gamed this — bills that should affect
  Planet Health but aren't tagged slip through scoring. **Per-bill
  meter-impact tags must be complete and verified at dataset-build time**;
  generalizes to other meter-impact tags. Folds into the **existing
  dataset-regeneration scripts** at `scripts/legislatorsToDataset.mjs` (or
  a sibling validator) — a CI/dataset-time validator at the existing
  pipeline. Not a standalone build item. → **dataset pipeline (§7)**.
- (DH-3 / DH-5 / #85 were cheap enough to promote to quick-wins QW5/QW6/QW7;
  DH-24 / DH-27 promoted to QW8/QW9 batch 6; **DH-30 promoted to QW10 batch 7**.
  DH-31 → E2 [bill-typing]; DH-32 → E25 [SCOTUS docket]; DH-35 → E11/E13/E24
  [era-gate the action libraries]; DH-33 → author-before-build [E29]; DH-34 →
  roadmap-decision [ship static].)

### Deferred / parking lot

- **Multiplayer — hot-seat (M1).** Round-robin the existing `needsPlayerInput`
  mechanism (`engine.ts:9`) across human factions before `advancePhase`.
  **Hard-blocked on K0 (determinism) AND on K2 + all six action libraries AND
  on K5 + the CPU handler suite** — the player-input modalities *are* the
  action libraries, and any CPU faction in the rotation uses the K5 handlers.
  **`drums` (all-CPU) confirms solo + multiplayer are two modes of one
  engine**: the K5 handlers serve both cases identically — a human taking over
  a CPU faction mid-campaign just disables the handler for that faction
  (§9.5). Also needs the singleton refactor: `playerFactionId` →
  `playerFactionIds: string[]` + audit every "is this me?" call site (debt
  #10). — gap #1, §9.5.
- **Multiplayer — async / backend (M2, L–XL epic).** IndexedDB is per-browser
  (`db.ts`); shared state needs a server (or CRDT/host-authoritative sync).
  Hard-blocked on K0 + M1. Exposes debt #6 (whole-snapshot clone+save
  bottleneck). — gap #1, §9.5.
- **Politician-to-politician trading (DH-37, NEW batch 8 — the #1 AMPU-2
  wishlist item).** A trade window between factions to swap politicians. A
  genuine small feature, but **not on any critical path** — it pairs with the
  era-boundary faction-trade window (mechanics §27.2 step 1, which DOES exist in
  spec) and with multiplayer. Park it. — DH-37 (`new1772`).
- **All-human Convention deadlock handling (DH-39, NEW batch 8 — multiplayer
  convention machinery).** With every faction human-controlled, the Convention
  can deadlock with no CPU compromise/dark-horse path to break it (`new1772`).
  The CPU side of convention deadlock is owned by E9 handler 9e (auto-drop-out +
  dark-horse, DH-8/DH-17); the **all-human** case needs an explicit
  deadlock-resolution rule that only matters once multiplayer (M1) lands — so it
  rides the convention epic (E10) + multiplayer. Park until M1. — DH-39
  (`new1772`).
- **Bill-scoring Phase B (divergence #1).** Re-tune `cardVoteBias`
  (`phaseRunners.ts:1516`) per-card-aware once the E20 leaderboard is live
  and playtested. — divergence #1.
- **Conversion-targeting refactor (divergence #3).** **Keep shipped for
  now.** Revisit after E19 emits a rule-driven `Can Party Flip` signal
  cleanly. (Listed as Phase-1 #21 in §9.6 "if pursued"; bundle DH-5's
  pairing-dissolution here if QW6 is deferred.) **`drums` #76 supplies the
  full 2-layer Disgruntled-auto-flip + active-poach %-table + adjacency
  gating + failure-strip — which becomes the K5 handler 9f spec when the
  refactor is approached.** — divergence #3, debt #13.
- **Named-ordinal meter relabel (presentation half).** The full labeled-
  ordinal meter *presentation* (vs the ±3 clamp in QW3 + crisis/cascade in
  E6) touches every meter read/write + the UI; ride it on the presentation
  track only if playtest says the numbers read poorly. The first-class
  war-score meter rides E3. — §21.8/§22.1.
- **Far-future / progressive era (post-1892, pre-modern).** Feminists /
  socialists / communists / prohibitionists / eugenicists / labor activists;
  movement/coalition spawning across eras (#6). The `progressive` enum
  value is added in K4; a `progressive` scenario lifts in once a
  progressive digest lands. **★ This is the FURTHEST the corpus documents — there
  is NO "Era of the Future" beyond it (batch-8 NEGATIVE RESULT).** No ingested
  thread reaches a post-Gilded/post-modern era (`tea1772`, titled "…to future,"
  stalls at 1874 mid-Gilded), so a future era has **no source and no build
  target**; **do NOT scope one**. K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`. — gap
  #2, #6; batch-8 negative result (`tea1772`).
- **Gilded-Age issue *system* depth.** Per-issue interest groups, full
  era-event spines, imperialism annexation flow distinct from `admitState`
  — beyond the E22 data shells. — gap #3, #6.
- **Cabinet "free pick-up" legislation (12b) + foreign-volunteer scheduling
  (#46).** The 1772 Treasurer free-pickup variant; events scheduling a
  future-draftable figure (Lafayette 1784) routed to the lowest-scoring
  eligible faction. (The general Executive-Branch-Interference form is E29;
  Free Executive proposals from SecTreas/SecWar are wired into E14's bill
  pipeline.) — gap #12b, #46.

## Sequencing notes

Why the order is what it is — the tech-lead's binding calls (§9 batch-8 lead +
§9.6 + §9.1.5 + §9.1.6 + §9.1.7 + §9.1.3 + §6.6.1). **Batch 8 is
CONFIDENCE-HARDENING, NOT a re-sequence** — the batch-8 leads come first (below),
then the three batch-7 leads, then the carried batch-5 leads. **The order itself
is UNCHANGED from batch 7.**

**★ Batch-8 lead — the ERA MODEL (K3/K4) is now the HIGHEST-confidence finding in
the KB; this batch changes confidence, not structure** (tech-lead §9 batch-8 lead
/ §9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump — NO re-sequence, NO new keystone):
> "Two independent saves emit the identical era-band sequence at identical in-game
> dates: `tea1772` (1772-start solo all-CPU) and `rep1800` (1800-start
> multiplayer), 28 in-game years apart. The bands are deterministic game-state
> content-gates, not GM flavor. **The K3/K4 spec was already condition-driven from
> batch 7 — nothing changes structurally.** This raises the era keystones to the
> **highest-confidence large bet in the roadmap**; treat the content-band model as
> settled."

So: (1) **K3/K4 are MULTI-SAVE PROVEN** — the safest large era bet; start there if
engine staffing is scarce. (2) **#102's dual era-scoring** (per-era + cumulative)
is the **WIN-CONDITION scoreboard** — it folds into K3/K4 point-banking (the win
condition is DUAL), not a new item. (3) **E16's dynamic-seat refactor is
reinforced** — `cabinetSeatsForYear` is the WRONG model at BOTH ends
(founding offices-by-law + modern bill-creates-a-seat), so it is foundational to
the offices-as-data theme, not modern-only. (4) **DH-41 is the one new
author-before-build item** (the general SCOTUS-ruling → statute cascade, deferred;
parking lot → 10 total). (5) **★ NEGATIVE RESULT — no thread reaches a "future"
era; the roadmap does NOT scope one (K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`).**
(6) **DH-36 (GM-burnout abandoned a 12-turn game) is the META justification** for
the whole build — cited in the intro, not queued. All other batch-8 deltas
(#100/#103/#104/#105 + DH-38/39/40/42/43/44) **fold into existing epics** with no
re-order; **DH-43 lands as QW11** (Vermont dataset fix).


**★ Batch-7 lead A — the ERA-MODEL REFRAME re-specs K3 + K4, it is NOT a new
keystone** (tech-lead §9.1.5 / §9.6 lead #0 / divergence #18 — the single most
important call this batch, and the biggest architectural reframe of the era
keystones across all 7 batches):
> "An 'era' in AMPU is a **content-band** — a set of available bills + era-events
> + draftees + a state-bias table — that the game advances through on **game-state
> / meter / territory-ownership triggers, evaluated per half-term**, NOT by
> matching a real calendar date… Verified: phases gate by `year % 4`/`year % 2`
> (`phases.ts:49-59`, **correct for cadence and stay**); the ONLY era advance is
> the hard-coded `currentEra = 'federalism'` at `constitutionalConvention.ts:198`;
> **there is no year→era derivation anywhere** — so this is a generalization of
> one existing trigger, not a rewrite. `advanceEra(snap)` watches an
> `era.advanceWhen` condition; content gates on `game.eraBand` + a new
> `territoryOwned` predicate, **not the calendar**. RECONCILES #68 per-era
> point-banking + §26 BootSheet boot model + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE
> era system."

So K3 changes from `advanceEra(snap, target)` to `advanceEra(snap)`; K4 gains the
per-era content-band registry `{bills, eraEvents, draftees, biasTable,
advanceWhen}`; the early sub-bands (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) are
content-band **markers**, not new enum values (tech-lead's call: markers first).
Both stay **M**. The new `territoryOwned` predicate is **one predicate, three
consumers** (bills, era-events, draft pool).

**★★ Batch-7 lead B — the RECONSTRUCTION SOLO-BLOCKER (DH-29) is a hard BUILD
REQUIREMENT on E3b** (tech-lead §9.1.6 / §9.6 lead #1 — the second-most-important
call, a hard gate on the 1856-arc shipping as a winnable solo game):
> "GM-verified (`rep1800` POST 9170): the historical Strict/Ironclad readmission
> plan can **NEVER pass with CPU factions** → **solo Reconstruction is
> UNRESOLVABLE**, which dead-ends the 1856-arc as a winnable solo scenario (and
> AMPU is single-player). **E3b's definition-of-done must include a CPU-passable
> readmission path** — my rec: (1) a CPU default-vote bias for the flagged
> historical plan (K5 handler #2) **+** (3) an era-boundary auto-resolution
> backstop (K3). The readmission half of E3b should land AFTER K5 handler #2 or
> carry the era-boundary auto-resolution as its self-contained fallback. **Ties
> E3b to the CPU handler suite (K5 / E9).**"

So E3b's readmission half (sub-PR d) is **gated on E9 handler #2 OR K3's
condition-driven `advanceEra`** — the one place the 1856-arc genuinely *needs* the
CPU handler suite, not merely benefits from it. The war half (a–c) is unblocked.

**★ Batch-7 lead C — IDEOLOGY-AS-CIRCLE is FOUNDATIONAL — a central-helper
refactor behind an era-gated flag; place it EARLY-ish (Phase-1 #5b / E5b)**
(tech-lead §9.1.7 / §9.6 lead #2 / divergence #19):
> "`IDEOLOGY_ORDER` (`types.ts:14`) is **LINEAR** and ideology distance is
> **open-coded at 10+ engine call sites** (`factionCenter` `phaseRunners.ts:715`,
> `stepToward` `:740`, conversion adjacency `:993-1003`, sponsor `:3548`, a
> private `firstContinentalCongress.ts:120` helper, + 3 UI pages) — **there is NO
> central distance helper today**. Add `ideologyDistance(a, b, circular)`, migrate
> the 10+ sites (behavior-preserving while `circular = false`), gate the wrap on
> `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?`. Steps 1-2 are **cheap and additive while the
> flag is off**, and they pay down a latent consistency risk — every later
> ideology consumer (the SCOTUS within-1-step auto-AYE §26.6, the conversion
> handler #6, the faction-center math) gets the single helper for free. **Not a
> keystone** (nothing blocks on it), but the cheapest while early and the most
> error-prone if deferred."

So E5b lands the helper + migration **before** E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n)
handlers, so they call it from day one rather than open-coding distance an
11th/12th time.

---

Carried batch-5 leads (still binding):

1. **K5 (`CpuController` scaffold) is a NEW late-keystone — after K0 + K2,
   parallel with K3/K4 + federalism** (tech-lead §9.6 call #1, §9.1.3 — the
   single most important batch-5 call):
   > "The shipped engine has **no agent-decision pass at all** (3 thin stubs
   > only). The §25 spec'd 15 subsystems have nowhere to live without it. K5
   > itself is ~120 lines (orchestrator + handler interface + tie-breaks + 2
   > `repair()` backfills + 1 determinism test). It **unlocks ~15 follow-on
   > handler PRs** that parallelize across contributors. K5 is a
   > force-multiplier, not a scenario gate — federalism + the 1856-arc epic
   > can ship with stubbed handlers and upgrade together."

   So K5 sits as the 6th Phase-0 keystone, parallel with K3/K4. The 15-handler
   suite is a single Phase-1 epic (E9) ordered by §6.6.1's handler-order table.

2. **Cabinet-confirmation system (DH-23) is XS-S, NOT M — because the broken
   system isn't built yet** (tech-lead §9.6 call #2, §9.3 #14):
   > "`runPhase_2_3_1_Cabinet` (`phaseRunners.ts:2158-2223`) is a one-step
   > scored pick with no Senate vote. So the fix is 'build the confirmation
   > step in the right shape from day one' (default-AYE baseline + Iron-Fist
   > Maj-Leader auto-AYE-own-picks + lobby-maximizer Admin-weighting), which
   > is CPU handler #4 (§6.6.1). Lands as a sibling of the cabinet-retention
   > refactor (Phase-1 #16)."

   So DH-23 is **not a quick-win**; it lands at E16 as the XS-S confirmation
   step + at E9 handler 9d for the CPU side.

3. **What's READY now vs. what still needs design** (tech-lead §9.6 call #3):
   > "**READY (no design task remaining):** the 13 §25 subsections #25.1–#25.8
   > + #25.10–#25.14 — all 15 CPU handlers can be authored against §25
   > verbatim. Plus #79 25/10/5 Justice drift, #80 ±3 swing cap, #82 veto
   > override 2/3, #83 midterm meter+enthusiasm, #85 5%/half-term
   > retire-death. **NEEDS DESIGN (parking lot):** divergence #10 / #84
   > contingent-election rules (5 rulesets invented mid-thread, no canonical
   > answer); §25.9 Iron-Fist split (the 6 child traits' exact names + cascade
   > rules); DH-1 filibustered-MUST-pass; DH-12 white-peace; DH-13
   > faithless-elector trigger; DH-14 era-aware bill impacts; DH-15
   > small-state multiplier."

   READY-now count went from ~30 to ~45+ this batch; needs-design grew from
   1 (DH-1) to 7 (DH-1 + #10/#84 + §25.9 + DH-12/13/14/15).

4. **BUG-0 is the cheapest win in the whole roadmap — do it first** (carried
   from batch 4):
   > "Verified: `RELOCATION_ATTEMPTS_PER_TURN = 5` at `types.ts:247`; one-line
   > const edit, no migration, no dependency."

   Sits at the very top of the quick-wins (QW0).

5. **Per-era point BANKING (#68) reshapes the era keystones + the win
   condition — not a new item** (carried from batch 4):
   > "The era boundary is a bank-and-zero + award + full 2.1.x→2.3.1 re-run +
   > content-swap pipeline; the per-era banks sum toward the (open) cross-era
   > win total. Build `advanceEra` with the bank step from the start."

6. **The Civil-War / Reconstruction epic lands EARLY-ish (E3b) because it
   COMPLETES a shipped scenario** (carried from batch 4):
   > "`scenario1856.ts` ships today but its era-event spine dead-ends at the
   > Trent Affair (1861); adding #56/#57/#58/#59 completes a half-finished
   > playable scenario."

   E3b sits right after generic war (E3) + K2, **not** behind federalism (E1)
   or the modern tail. **Batch 5 adds: it is the first scenario to get a full
   K5 handler suite — wire handlers as they land.**

7. **Generic war (E3) is DESIGNED multi-theater + tiered from day one — with
   the multi-confirmed formula** (tech-lead §9.6, sharpened batch 5):
   > "`drums` re-derives the formula `Win% = Difficulty + Planning + Officer×10
   > + MilPrep + Benchmarks` end-to-end across Eastern + Western + Utah + WWI
   > + Mexico + Sioux — the single most multiply-confirmed cross-era resolver
   > in the knowledge base. `WS ≥ +11` auto-win; war-end `WS×2 = %`; post-war
   > defeat `|WS|×2×10`; naval-N-then-ground per-war; Treaty A-D + 3-roll
   > chain. The Civil War is the Major-tier instance — a configured instance,
   > not a rewrite."

8. **K2 (ActionRegistry) remains the second-most-important keystone after K0**
   (~6× leverage across 6 action libraries) **AND is a hard prerequisite for
   K5** — most CPU handlers pick from a registry library. Do K2 first if only
   one keystone lands this quarter.

9. **The two-track parallelization is still the biggest schedule lever**
   (tech-lead §9.4, §9.6). Sync points: a handful of additive `Politician`/
   `Party` fields + two deeper handoffs (A4 ↔ E3 war odds; P2 ↔ E8 portraits).
   Start the presentation track immediately with P0.

10. **(carried) #8 cabinet, #7 SCOTUS, the two scaling walls, far-end vs
    near-term.** #8 is a real cabinet wipe→retention refactor (M, E16) —
    batch 2 wrongly said no wipe exists (`:3804-3812`). #7 SCOTUS is
    from-scratch over a *stub* (`:3398-3414`), far-end (E25). The two
    scaling walls (persist House slates E7; procedural pol gen E8) are
    NEAR-term, not modern-only. Federalism before gilded before modern;
    `scenario1788` before a fully-general `advanceEra`.

11. **RNG first (K0).** Determinism is the prerequisite for multiplayer
    AND for **K5's deterministic tie-breaks** (every CPU decision must be
    reproducible from the seed), AND any replay/test harness, a soft gate
    for every roll-heavy subsystem (war E3/E3b, convention E10, governor
    d100s E11, filibuster E14, primary E24), **and a hard gate for the
    seeded procedural pol generator (E8)**.

12. **Within-track dependency notes.** **E18g (numeric `nationalSurplus`/
    `nationalDebt`) is a prerequisite for E2's cap *and* E6's debt field —
    build that sub-item early.** E4's global flip + the 12A toggle need E5
    (amendments). **E4b (early-republic cluster) splits its deps: (a)
    slavery-flag+Cohens needs E25's SCOTUS docket [the `Cohens` rule-modifier]
    + E5 [the abolition amendment]; (b) Second Bank needs K2 + E13 + the E16
    dynamic seat list; (c) statehood-by-bill needs E21 + K3's `territoryOwned`
    predicate.** **E5b (ideology-as-circle) is independent but lands steps 1-2
    BEFORE E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n) handlers so they call the central
    helper from day one.** E21's statehood needs E2 + E3 + E8 + K3's
    `territoryOwned` predicate; **E3b's Canada arc (#60) needs E21's per-era
    admission gate.** **★★ E3b's Reconstruction readmission half (DH-29) needs
    E9 handler #2 (CPU default-vote bias) OR K3's condition-driven `advanceEra`
    (era-boundary auto-resolution) — its DoD.** E10b's VP-vacancy fill needs
    E5. E14e (investigation) needs E2's bill type. E24 needs E10's CPU delegate
    engine + handler 9i. E26 needs E23. E28 needs E7. **All 15 E9 handlers
    need K5; 9k/9l also need K5's persistent state.** P1/P2/P3 consume P0.

### Estimate caution

Sizes are the tech-lead's. Rows that may still feel XL after a first pass:

- **E3b (Civil-War / Reconstruction)** — sized L but it is a full subsystem;
  **ship as 5 sub-PRs** (secession #58 → sectional crisis #59 → two-theater
  war #56 + CW variants #97 → Reconstruction #57 → Canada #60), cheap-first.
  **★★ The Reconstruction sub-PR (d) carries the DH-29 solo-blocker DoD** —
  it lands AFTER E9 handler #2 (CPU default-vote bias) or carries K3's
  era-boundary auto-resolution as its self-contained fallback. Do not ship
  the readmission half without a CPU-passable path.
- **E1 (federalism / early-republic epic)** — sized L; expect the era-event
  spine and the SCOTUS set to each be their own sub-PR. The early-republic
  subsystems are folded OUT into E4 + E4b (sequenced after their keystones).
- **E4b (early-republic cluster)** — sized M but **3 independent sub-PRs**
  with different deps (slavery-flag+Cohens → SCOTUS docket + E5; Second Bank
  → K2 + E13 + E16 seat list; statehood-by-bill → E21 + K3's `territoryOwned`);
  ship them as they unblock, not as one epic.
- **E9 (CPU handler suite)** — **~15 PRs**, not one. Order by §6.6.1; ship
  one at a time. Handlers 9k/9l (the DH-* architectural gaps with persistent
  state) land **after** the simpler handlers have exercised the scaffold.
- **E10 (convention)** — the single biggest unbuilt subsystem; **split into
  ~3** (ballot loop → inter-ballot library on K2 → platform/VP/scandal).
  The CPU side is owned by handler 9e (E9), not by this epic.
- **E14 (legislative micro-mechanics)** — now **7 sub-PRs** sharing the bill
  pipeline (block-and-replace → packaging → filibuster → crisis tag →
  investigation #54 → veto override #82 → midterm #83).
- **E16 (cabinet + Congress + offices-by-law + confirmation)** — **four
  coupled jobs** (9-role Congressional pipeline, the cabinet-wipe→retention
  refactor, the XS-S confirmation step DH-23, offices-created-by-law #66);
  **split if any feels XL during scoping.**
- **E30 (modern era scenario)** — the XL capstone; decomposes into roster +
  era-event spine + bill catalog + card pool sub-PRs; gates on most of Phase
  1 + 2.
- **P2 (portrait pipeline)** — an asset-pipeline epic; the no-AI-in-product
  constraint shapes the tech choice from day one; must render generated pols
  (shared with E8).

## Provenance note

This reflects **batches 1–8** — **ten** ingested digests: the `f4c7c2c4` 1868
Gilded-Age multiplayer dry-run, the `f55d3e21` 1788 federalism solo-with-AI
playtest, the `85f8e6b4` 1772 solo aesthetic experiment, the `3a9ac985` modern
(1948→2020) multiplayer campaign, the `77db6e6f` **1856-native "A House Divided"
Part 2** (9051 posts — the only source for the Civil-War / Reconstruction /
secession machinery), the `e1776bbd` **all-CPU "Drums of War"** (7540 posts — the
first explicit forum record of CPU heuristics), the `c50d9da7` **"Era of
Populism" 2012 fresh-modern boot** (1172 posts — the canonical `BootSheet` +
meter-driven endgame), `rep1800` — the **"Era of Republicanism" 1800→1868
early-republic campaign** (the first procedural record of the 1800–1856 early
republic and the predecessor of batch-1's `gilded`), and now the **two batch-8
1772 threads**: **`new1772`** (the **first MULTIPLAYER 1772 founding campaign** —
10 humans 1772→1796, the entire federal apparatus stood up piece-by-piece from a
1772 start; **abandoned at GM burnout**) + **`tea1772`** (a 157-post **solo all-CPU
1772→1874 fast-traversal** that stalls mid-Gilded). **The 1800 campaign is
documented end-to-end** (1800→1868 in batch 7, 1868→Gilded in batch 1), and the
**1772 founding is now corroborated from both a multiplayer and a solo-all-CPU
angle**. **This batch-8 pass is CONFIDENCE-HARDENING — NO re-sequence:**

- **★ bumps K3/K4 (the era model) to HIGHEST confidence — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN**
  (§9.1.5 batch-8 bump): `tea1772` (1772-start) + `rep1800` (1800-start, 28 in-game
  years apart) emit the identical era-band sequence at identical dates (#102), so
  the content-band model is settled. No structural change; **#102's dual
  era-scoring (per-era + cumulative) is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard**, folded into
  K3/K4 point-banking (#68);
- **★ strengthens E16's dynamic-seat refactor justification** —
  `cabinetSeatsForYear` confirmed the WRONG model at BOTH ends (founding
  offices-by-law `new1772` §24.6 + modern bill-creates-a-seat `pop`), no new work;
- **★ adds DH-41 to the author-before-build parking lot (now 10 total)** — the
  general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade, UNBUILT and `vcczar`-deferred;
- **folds the new small mechanics into existing epics:** #100 (SCOTUS-overturns-
  amendment + amendable-threshold) → E5 + E25; #103 (pres-vote modifier stack +
  era-issue list) + DH-42 (meter-vs-lean balance) → E20; #104 (lone-ideology
  convention exploit) → E9 handler 9e; #105 (stat-collapse → forced resignation) →
  E10b; DH-38 (late-ratification/Rogue-Island window) → E1; DH-40 (justice-count
  not packaged → stall) → E14b + E25 (XS-S); DH-44 (post-12A vote count) → E4;
- **adds QW11** (DH-43 Vermont home-state dataset fix, XS);
- **parks** DH-37 (no pol-trading, #1 AMPU-2 wishlist) + DH-39 (all-human
  Convention deadlock) on the multiplayer track;
- **★ records the NEGATIVE RESULT** — no thread reaches a "future" era, so the
  roadmap does NOT scope one (K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`);
- **cites DH-36** (GM burnout abandoned a 12-turn game) as the META justification
  for the whole build (intro rationale, not a queued row).

The batch-7 re-sequence that this pass leaves UNCHANGED:

- **★ re-specs K3 + K4 for the era-model reframe — NOT a new keystone** (§9.1.5 /
  divergence #18): `advanceEra(snap)` becomes condition-driven (game-state /
  meter / TERRITORY, per half-term — no `target` arg; the CC `:198` line becomes
  the first `advanceWhen` condition); content gates on `game.eraBand` + a new
  `territoryOwned` predicate (one predicate, three consumers), not the calendar;
  the early sub-bands (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) are content-band
  markers; the per-era content-band registry `{bills, eraEvents, draftees,
  biasTable, advanceWhen}` lands at K4. **Reconciles #68 + §26 + §27.1 into one
  era system.** `year % 4`/`year % 2` stay as phase cadence;
- **★★ adds the Reconstruction solo-blocker (DH-29) as a hard DoD requirement on
  E3b** (§9.1.6): the Strict/Ironclad readmission plan can NEVER pass with CPU →
  solo Reconstruction unwinnable; E3b's readmission half must ship a CPU
  default-vote bias (E9 handler #2) AND/OR an era-boundary auto-resolution (K3);
  ties E3b to the CPU handler suite;
- **★ adds ideology-as-circle as Phase-1 #5b (E5b)** (§9.1.7 / divergence #19):
  a central `ideologyDistance(a,b,circular)` helper + migration of the 10+
  open-coded sites, behind a `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?` flag — placed early
  so E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n) handlers call it from day one;
- **folds the early-republic subsystems into E1 + Phase-1 #4/#4b** (E4 12A
  legislature-elector toggle #93; new E4b = slavery-flag+Cohens #94 [SMALLER —
  `State.isSlaveState` already exists] + Second Bank+Bank War #95 +
  statehood-by-bill organize→admit + territory-gate #95);
- **merges era-events-predating-start into BUG-1 (QW1)** — LIVE-confirmed by the
  LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-start episode — and **adds DH-30
  event-scheduler-min-floor as QW10**, BUG-1's companion;
- **places DH-31** (procedure-bill veto-misroute) at E2, **DH-32** (SCOTUS-voids-
  a-state guard + the `Cohens` ruling-bill-class modifier) at E25, **DH-35**
  (era-gate the action libraries) at E11/E13/E24;
- **adds DH-33** (impeachment-rewrite) to author-before-build (E29) and **resolves
  DH-34** as a roadmap DECISION (ship static era-biases — the forum's own stance);
- **notes `scenario1800` (E32)** as an optional later `BootSheet` instance (the
  band is already covered by `scenario1788` + `scenario1856`).

And the batch-8 confidence-hardening pass (this one) leaves all of the above
**unchanged in order** — it bumps K3/K4 to HIGHEST confidence (multi-save proven),
strengthens E16's justification, adds DH-41 to the parking lot (→ 10), folds
#100/#103/#104/#105 + DH-38/39/40/42/43/44 into existing epics, adds QW11
(Vermont), and records the no-future-era guard + the DH-36 META rationale.

**Still provisional.** Subsequent `/ingest-playtest` runs will refine scopes
(especially the CPU handler internals, the contingent-election rules, the
§25.9 split, the convention CPU specifics, the Civil-War sub-splits, the
~16-meter Lingering order, and the cross-era win-total number the per-era
banks sum to), may re-split currently L-sized rows, and may surface items now
parked or unknown. **The order above is buildable top-to-bottom today;
re-validate on every digest.** Open design calls that gate ordering
(contingent-election rules, §25.9 Iron-Fist split, DH-12 white-peace, DH-13
faithless-elector cap, DH-14 era-aware bill ideology, DH-15 small-state
multiplier, era-event scheduling hybrid, era-enum split, meter relabel,
procedural-generation distribution, DH-1 filibuster remedy, **DH-33 impeachment
rewrite**, **DH-41 the general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade policy
[batch 8 — author before building it into E25]**, draft 3/3-canonical, Civil-War
end-year, cross-era win total, **and the batch-7 era-model open Qs — are the early
sub-bands content-band markers or enum values [tech-lead's call: markers first];
the exact scope of the `territoryOwned` content-gate; which Reconstruction
readmission fix E3b ships (CPU bias #1 vs era-boundary auto-resolution #3 vs both
— tech-lead's rec: 1+3]**) are tracked in `game-context.md` → Open questions.
