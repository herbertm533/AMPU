# AMPU — Roadmap

> **Batch-11 version — LATE-GAME-SYSTEM PLACEMENTS + one fork RESOLVED (NO
> re-sequence, NO new keystone, NO keystone moves). The first FULL-ARC 1820→1840
> continuation (`arkzag`, "Ark and Zags — The Era of Democracy", 152c2881, 2531
> posts) — the direct continuation of batch-10's `dem1820` 1820 save, run all the way
> to 1840.** Batch 11 is the thread that finally **exercised the LATE-GAME systems
> batch 10 never reached** (multi-cycle presidential elections, the Bank-War economic
> arc, amendment machinery, presidential assassination+succession) — so it is
> **placement + one fork-resolution, not a re-sequence**: (1) **★ #116 economic engine
> → NEW small epic `E4c`** (the Jacksonian Bank-War → Independent-Treasury long-run
> content **state machine**), placed **AFTER E2 + E6 + E4b(b)** — it sits on top of
> E4b(b)'s §27.6 Second-Bank institution (the Bank it recharters/replaces), needs E2's
> `Bill.type`/crisis-bypass, and needs E6's named EconStab meter + crisis/cascade.
> Build it **EMERGENT, not scripted** — recurring CRISIS bills resolving an EconStab
> CRISIS via a `Bill.replaces` field + a per-bill-class `lockedUntilYear` tariff
> cooldown (carry "scripted-vs-emergent" as a design note, not a blocker). Verified
> UNBUILT: `applyEffect` (`phaseRunners.ts:3209`) only nudges 7 meters; `Legislation`
> (`types.ts:1506`) has no `type`/`replaces`/`lockedUntilYear`. (2) **★ #119 amendment
> lifecycle → RE-SCOPES existing E5** (NOT a new epic): adds the explicit lifecycle
> state (propose→committee→floor→**governor-ratify**→active), the **active-amendment-
> blocks-a-legislation-class** hook (the proactive face of E5's existing *Pollock*
> gate), and the **un-bundleable** flag. Verified UNBUILT: no `amendments` field in
> `GameState`. (3) **★ #61 succession chain → RE-SCOPES existing E10b** (NOT a new
> epic): adds VP-succeeds-on-death → fill-VP (gated on E5's VP-vacancy amendment being
> `active`) → acting-president action-divert roll + trait-acquisition side-effect.
> NOTE the **kill trigger already SHIPS** (`assassination-killed` anytime event
> `anytimeEvents.ts:232` fires `{kind:'death'}`; death sets `presidentId=null` via
> `vacateOffice` `phaseRunners.ts:2449`) — the **succession ENGINE is the work**; the
> **line-of-succession/impeachment half stays parking-lot (DH-54)**. (4) **★ #51
> PROMOTED — now SETTLED** (the `arkzag` final chunk published the `drums` **4-step
> enthusiasm-reshuffle** verbatim, MATCHING `drums`, NOT Ted's "every state" nor
> Matt's "primaries-only"): the **4-step reshuffle + −100/waiver rule → E23, now
> `ready`**; the **±3 cap is UNCONDITIONALLY ready** (binds at `calcStateVote`
> `:3709-3711`, ships with E6). **Only the #18 state-scope sub-question stays a human
> decision-gate** — #51's "fork" entry LEAVES Decision-gated; **only #18 remains
> there.** (5) **★ NEW delegate-class fork → Decision-gated** (AI-allocator-by-EV-
> formula vs player-rigged): a human pick **before E10's delegate-apportionment
> sub-PR** (+ E24's primary apportionment), but does NOT block the rest of E10. (6)
> **Bugs:** **DH-59 (XS)** folds into **E12** when the 9-point relations scale is
> built (no standalone patch; today it clamps −5..5 at `applyEffect:3223`); **DH-60
> (S)** = the concrete face of #92 territory-gating → a **`requires?: Predicate` on the
> era-event row + a firing-path filter** = the **same surface as BUG-1 + K3's
> `territoryOwned`**, so **build with E15 + BUG-1** (`buildEraEventsForYear`
> `eraEvents1856.ts:4` gates only by year; `EraEvent` `types.ts:1466` has no
> precondition field). (7) **#115 scenario-boot priority UNCHANGED** (re-confirmed by
> the continuation-boot; stays at the front of the subsystem queue, §9.1.9). (8) **★★
> Meta-signal FLIPS POSITIVE:** no GA-burnout this time (heavy GA scripting absorbed
> the upkeep) — now a **3-thread signal** (2 burnout deaths + 1 survived-by-scripting)
> that STRENGTHENS the automation-reduces-upkeep argument behind E9/#55/#115. Cite it

> 6. **CPU handler #2 (legislation) and handler #4 (cabinet) consume the
>    conditional-vote-rules primitive** (`pop` POST 1111). Iron-Fist
>    controllers publish declarative `Predicate → {AYE/NAY}` policies stored
>    at `Faction.factionLeader.compelledVoteRule?`. Handler #2 consults this
>    BEFORE the §25.6 NAY/AYE heuristic; handler #4 consumes the same primitive

> 7. **Two new XS quick-win validators (QW8 + QW9)** for boot-pipeline data
>    quality: **QW8 Senate-class verifier (DH-24)** + **QW9 `TRAIT_CONFLICTS`
>    validator at boot/dataset import (DH-27)**. Both land at K4's boot
>    pipeline; both are XS one-validator helpers.
> 8. **DH-25 (career-track bootstrap unresolved) is the biggest new parking-lot
>    item — it BLOCKS modern scenario shipping.** 3-year-stale design discussion
>    has no canonical rule for which existing pols start on career tracks at a
>    mid-game boot. Author the rule (Zagnut's "1996+, 1/track" houserule is on
>    the table) before `scenario1948` or `scenario2012` ships (Phase-2 #30/#31).
> 9. **DH-26 3rd-party VP-trait "prohibitive" folds into E26** (third-party

## Now shipped (history)

Reverse-chronological. The expertise/abilities/traits/cabinet/lobby epic (PR1–7)
is complete; the knowledge-base infra and eight ingestion batches are knowledge
milestones (no code, but they are what every item below is traced to).

- **Batch-11 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed `arkzag` — the **first
  FULL-ARC 1820→1840 continuation** ("Ark and Zags — The Era of Democracy",
  152c2881; **2531 posts**, the direct continuation of batch-10's `dem1820` 1820 save
  run forward through fictional D-R presidents Benton→Cheves→Enoch-Lincoln→Dudley to
  1840 — a party system that never realigns). It is the thread that finally
  **exercised the LATE-GAME systems batch 10 never reached**: multi-cycle presidential
  elections, the Bank-War→Independent-Treasury economic arc, Force-Bill/tariff fights,
  amendment machinery, and a presidential **assassination → succession**. The headline
  value is **placement + ONE fork-resolution, not a re-sequence**: it (1) **adds NEW
  small epic `E4c`** — the **#116 Jacksonian Bank-War → Independent-Treasury long-run
  ECONOMIC content state machine** — placed **AFTER E2 + E6 + E4b(b)** (it recharters/
  replaces E4b(b)'s Second Bank, needs E2's `Bill.type`/crisis-bypass + E6's EconStab
  meter); built **EMERGENT** (recurring CRISIS bills resolving an EconStab CRISIS via a
  `Bill.replaces` field + a per-bill-class `lockedUntilYear` tariff cooldown), with
  "scripted-vs-emergent" carried as a design note; (2) **RE-SCOPES E5** (amendments)
  with **#119**'s explicit lifecycle (propose→committee→floor→**governor-ratify**→
  active) + the **active-amendment-blocks-a-legislation-class** hook + the
  **un-bundleable** flag — NOT a new epic; (3) **RE-SCOPES E10b** (succession) with
  **#61**'s VP-succeeds-on-death → fill-VP (gated on E5's VP-vacancy amendment) →
  acting-president action-divert roll + trait side-effect — noting the **kill trigger
  already SHIPS** (`anytimeEvents.ts:232` → `vacateOffice` `phaseRunners.ts:2449`), so
  the **succession ENGINE is the work**; the **line-of-succession/impeachment half
  stays parking-lot (DH-54)**; (4) **PROMOTES #51 to E23 `ready`** — the `arkzag` final
  chunk published the `drums` **4-step enthusiasm-reshuffle + −100/waiver rule**
  verbatim (settling the `dem1820` fork to `drums`, NOT Ted's "every state" / Matt's
  "primaries-only") — and marks the **±3 cap UNCONDITIONALLY ready** (ships with E6);
  **#51's "fork" entry LEAVES the Decision-gated category**; (5) **adds a NEW
  delegate-class fork to Decision-gated** (AI-allocator-by-EV-formula vs player-rigged —
  a pick before E10's delegate-apportionment sub-PR), so Decision-gated stays at **2
  items (#18 state-scope + delegate-class)**; (6) **slots DH-59** (relations-meter
  under-floor, XS → **E12** when the 9-point scale is built) + **DH-60** (era-events
  fire with no territory/asset prereq, S → **E15 + BUG-1**, a `requires?: Predicate` on
  the era-event row); and (7) **re-confirms #115 scenario-boot priority UNCHANGED** (the
  continuation-boot proved a mid-game save can be picked up cleanly) + **flips the
  meta-signal POSITIVE** — no GA-burnout this time (heavy scripting absorbed the upkeep)
  → a **3-thread automation-reduces-upkeep signal** (cited as the E9/#55/#115
  prioritization argument, NOT a row). Gap log gained **#116** + **#119** (NEW),
  **#51 FORK-RESOLVED**, **DH-59 + DH-60** (NEW), + corroborations of
  #61/#13/#111/#11/#44/#92/#52/#59/#40/#85/#115. `technical-guide.md` §9 updated (NO
  re-sequence, NO new keystone, NO keystone moves): **E4c added (deps E2+E6+E4b(b),
  emergent)**; **E5/E10b re-scoped**; **#51 promoted to E23, ±3 cap un-gated**;
  **delegate-class fork added + #51 fork removed from Decision-gated**; **DH-59/DH-60
  slotted**. _Complete._
- **Batch-10 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed `dem1820` — the **first
  1820-START** in the KB ("1820 — The Era of Democracy", cc37d770; a NEW 1820
  scenario start, Monroe's 2nd term / late Era-of-Good-Feelings → Jacksonian "Era of
  Democracy"; **947 posts**, 10-human MP with the **1788/1800 polarity** — BLUE
  Dem-Republicans + RED Federalists/National-Republicans). A **short, corroboration-
  rich** thread (runs ~1.5 turns to ~1822-23; **GA-burnout-killed in real-time Aug
  2025**, never reaches the 1824 cycle / Jackson / Nullification). The headline value
  is **PROMOTION + decision-gating, not new scope**: it (1) **promotes the scenario-
  boot pipeline (#115) to the front of the subsystem queue — folded into K4's
  `BootSheet` schema (NOT a new keystone)**: there are **NO documented rules for
  CREATING a game**, so the build's shared `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` pipeline must
  canonicalize the improvised GA setup (strip-Command house rule, inaugural career-
  track seed from the last-3 classes, era-keyed industry init, Senate-class assign,
  vacant-seat fill); built **WITH the first new scenario before the third hand-
  authored copy**, and the venue for the XS boot validators + the appointment-ladder
  (#115b); (2) **decision-gates TWO forks** the build cannot pick alone — **#52
  player-controlled SCOTUS** (3 live models; docket data structure needed either way
  → E25) and **#18/#51 meter→enthusiasm→election** (3 live models; the settled ±3 cap
  is a queued XS clamp blocked on the pick); (3) **slots sized corroborated fixes** —
  **DH-53 bill-EV-sign S** (author structured bill-effect tables → E20/K4), **DH-24
  Senate-class XS** (boot pipeline / QW8), **focus-Rep (EV−2)/5 #55 M** (E7+E28),
  **statehood→sectional-crisis #59 S** (E3b additive at `admitState`),
  **appointment-ladder/replacement-gains #115b XS** (boot/appointment rules); (4)
  **makes the #92 era-band model 4-START-CONFIRMED** (1772+1800+1820+1948 — the
  draft table prints the Democracy/Manifest-Destiny bands), a confidence bump on
  K3/K4; and (5) **records the ★★ 2nd GA-burnout DEATH** (DH-36, after `new1772`) —
  the prioritization ARGUMENT for the upkeep-reducing items (NOT a row). Gap log
  gained **#115** (no rules for creating a game → scenario-boot pipeline) +
  corroborations of #1/#18/#24/#44/#51/#52/#55/#59/#61/#76/#86/#92/#101/#108 +
  DH-24/DH-25/DH-27/DH-36/DH-53 from a NEW start year. `technical-guide.md` §9
  updated (NO re-sequence, NO new keystone): **#115 promoted to the front of the
  subsystem queue inside K4's `BootSheet`**; **#52 + #18/#51 recorded decision-gated**;
  **DH-53/DH-24/#55/#59/#115b sized + slotted**; **#92 4-start confidence bump**;
  **DH-36 2nd-death cited as the upkeep-automation prioritization argument**.
  _Complete._
- **Batch-9 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed `nuke` — the **Nuclear-Age
  / Cold-War / modern-half campaign** (a 1948-start "Era of the Nuclear Age
  1948–2000 → Era of Terror 2000–~2005" thread; at **12,228 posts the LARGEST
  corpus in the KB**). It is the **chronological predecessor of the
  already-documented `modern` 2004-2020 thread** — joined at the 2004 election — so
  the **KB now spans a CONTINUOUS 1772→2020 timeline.** The headline value is
  **confidence + scope-control, not new scope** (a *final-role* confirmation pass):
  it makes the **era model 3-START-CONFIRMED** (1772 `tea1772` + 1800 `rep1800` +
  **1948 `nuke`** all emit the band model) and adds the **two-level era refinement**
  (Historical Eras carry **rule-deltas** — the Era-of-Terror cabinet rework — AND a
  separate per-decade census doing EV-realloc + bias-re-lean + content-rotation),
  and it records the **★★ NEGATIVE SCOPE finding — no Cold-War subsystem to build**
  (only `revolutionaryWar.ts` exists; the Cold War = the generic war engine + the
  diplomacy subsystem + content). Gap log gained rows **#106–#114** (Cold-War =
  relabeled generic war [no nuclear/MAD/NATO/space/branch subsystem; USSR never
  falls]; the diplomacy subsystem [8 relation meters + ambassador actions]; gradual
  4-lever realignment; era CONTENT fires on its own scripted clock; the modern
  election machine; the modern institutional layer [impeachment/resignation/

  (a 157-post **solo all-CPU 1772→1874 fast-traversal** that stalls mid-Gilded —

### Quick-wins — land immediately (XS each, high feel-value)

Fixes + cheap divergence/balance resolutions. **BUG-0 is at the very top — the
cheapest win in the roadmap.** **BUG-1 is the exception that matters:** it is XS
but a **hard gate on the federalism epic** — land it *in or just before* E1.
**Batch 7: BUG-1 now ALSO subsumes the era-events-predating-start-DROPPED hole**
(LIVE-confirmed by `rep1800`'s LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-start episode — a 2nd
same-class instance; same bug, merged). **QW10 (DH-30 event-scheduler-min-floor)
is BUG-1's companion** on the same scheduling surface. DH-2 (modern deck fired
off-year cards) is the **same scheduling surface** as BUG-1 + divergence #4 and is
investigated at E15, not as its own quick-win.

| # | Item | Scope | Depends on | Size | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QW0 | **BUG-0 — relocation cap `5`→`4` (divergence #9)** *(do FIRST)* | **One-line const edit:** `RELOCATION_ATTEMPTS_PER_TURN = 4` at `types.ts:247` (shipped value is `5`). The designer changed it to 4 mid-thread and it went **live in the running playtest**; the browser engine never caught up. **Settled value, no migration** (a tunable const, not a save field), no dependency. The auto-Carpetbagger + 10-yr-expiry + alt-state-exemption *feature* is QW4 / E17 — this row is **only** the stale constant. **The cheapest win in the whole roadmap.** | — | XS | bug BUG-0 / divergence #9 (`hd` §0/I-1, 7062-7066, 7555) + codebase (`types.ts:247`) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW1 | **BUG-1 — era-event era-lock filter (now ALSO subsumes era-events-predating-start-DROPPED, batch 7)** *(federalism gate)* | Add an era-vs-start-year filter to `buildEraEventsForYear` (`phaseRunners.ts:2817`): an event whose era is past the scenario's start era is treated as already-happened and excluded from the roll table — **BUT** the official ruling (`fed` POST 524) also means a start year *past* an era wrongly **loses** that era's still-pending content (an **1800-start game wrongly loses the Louisiana Purchase**). **Batch 7 LIVE-CONFIRMS this exact bug:** `rep1800` §A POST 2668 — the GM found the LA Purchase was filed under the prior Era of Federalism and "not included" for an 1800-start game; he hand-added it in 1816. Same bug, **merged** (the era-events-predating-start-DROPPED hole is the same defect, not a new row). Latent today; **a blocker the moment a 3rd scenario (1788/1800) ships** — so this rides with E1. **Resolve together with QW10 (DH-30 min-floor) + DH-2 + divergence #4** (one scheduling surface, at E15). | — | XS | bug BUG-1 (`fed` 521-535; **`rep1800` §A 2668 LIVE-confirms**), DH-2 (`modern` 2221) — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF (2 era) | ready |
| QW2 | **BUG-3 — no-PM-General fallback guard** | Defensive guard on the `GeneralInChief` fill path (`phaseRunners.ts:2255`): empty-pool ⇒ leave vacant + log (or auto-generate a stopgap officer — ties to E8 procedural pol gen). Closes a potential crash. | — | XS | bug BUG-3 (`fed` 5, 119) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW3 | **±3-per-phase meter-swing clamp (meter-model divergence; now confirmed live by `drums` #80)** | One-helper change: clamp every `NationalMeters` write to ±3 per phase (`types.ts:1399`). **Batch 5 extends this:** apply the same clamp to **cabinet ideology net-swings** and **per-phase ideology swings** at the same chokepoint (#80, `drums` POST 4574 — a live designer patch). Orthogonal to the full named-ordinal relabel (parked) and to E6's crisis/cascade rules (which build on it). Cheap balance/feel win. **★ Batch-11 — the ±3 cap is now UNCONDITIONALLY READY (no longer gated on any fork).** Batch 10 flagged the cap as the "settled half" of the #18/#51 fork; the `arkzag` continuation then **RESOLVED the #51 enthusiasm-SHIFT step** (the 4-step rule, verbatim `drums` — now at **E23, `ready`**), so the cap binds with no open dependency. **This QW3 clamp on `NationalMeters` writes is buildable NOW**, and the same ±3 cap on ideology+party-pref swings **ships with E6 at `calcStateVote` `phaseRunners.ts:3709-3711`** (which today applies enthusiasm UNIFORMLY with **NO ±3 cap and NO per-state penalty**). **The ONLY piece still BLOCKED on a human pick is #18's meter→election STATE SCOPE** (every-state-unless-penalized vs ideology-leaning-states-only — recorded under "Decision-gated", folds into E20/E23); the cap itself and the enthusiasm-SHIFT engine are NOT gated. | — | XS | meter model §21.8/§22.1/§22.2 (`1772s`; `modern`; **`drums` #80 POST 4574**) + **#51 ±3 cap settled (`dem1820`; `arkzag` ch33 2438-2456)** — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF | ready |
| QW4 | **Auto-Carpetbagger on alt-state moves (divergence #2)** | Replace the 4-step probability ladder with auto-grant on a successful alt-state relocation; add 10-year expiry + exempt alt-state moves from the relocation cap (now 4/half-term after QW0). More legible; removes a dead dial. | QW0 (the cap value) | XS | gap #38, divergence #2 (`gilded` 36; `1772s` 3-52; `modern` 147; `hd` I-1; **`drums` POSTS 2627, 2630-2634, 2755, 7465 add the per-roll % table + recent-state filter**) — HI-CONF (5 era) | ready |
| QW5 | **DH-3 — bar career-track pols from the presidency** | Add a guard at presidential-candidate eligibility (and CPU presidential selection) so career-track pols can't run — closing a GM-acknowledged rules gap (career-track is already barred from Gov/Rep/leadership/Kingmaker). Relates to the primary (E22) but is a cheap standalone guard now. | — | XS | DH-3 (`hd` 8205-8219; relates to #63) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW6 | **DH-5 — Kingmaker-pairing dissolution on flip** | A rule in the conversion path: converting/flipping a Kingmaker no longer seizes his protégés (or their +1 election standing) — flagged "insanely OP." Same code area as Reconstruction amnesty (E3b prunes broken Kingmaker pairs). Cheap balance fix on shipped Kingmaker/conversion machinery (`KINGMAKER_RULES` `types.ts:295`, `CONVERSION_ODDS` `:268`). | — | XS–S | DH-5 (`hd` 7589, 8762; relates to #29/#30) — CARRIED | ready |
| **QW7** | **#85 — 5%/half-term retire/death + mandatory military-officer retire at 75** *(batch 5)* | A 1-line refinement of `MORTALITY_RULES` per-era table (`types.ts:485`): per-half-term **5% retirement/death roll for senators + cabinet** + mandatory **military-officer retire at 75** + ~10% baseline cabinet-decline roll. Tyler patched this mid-run (POST 5437) to solve CPU stagnation in long campaigns. **Pure tunable; no shape change; cheap.** | — | XS | #85 (`drums` 2493, 5437, 6469) — CARRIED | ready |
| **QW8** | **DH-24 — Senate-class verifier at K4 boot pipeline** *(NEW, batch 6)* | A one-helper `validateSenateClasses(snap)` that, at scenario-boot time AND at `loadStandardDraftClasses` (`standardDraftClasses.ts:13`), checks each sitting senator's last-election year against their assigned Senate class (I/II/III) and flags mismatches. `pop` POST 272/297/298: a fresh modern boot's seed data had Ron Johnson (WI) up in 2010 instead of 2012; GM had to swap classes mid-election. **One pure validator helper, run at K4's boot pipeline.** Lands at the K4 boot pipeline (does NOT require K4 to be fully built — can ship as a standalone helper now, then wire into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline when K4 lands). **★ Batch-10 — corroborated AGAIN from a 4th start year:** `dem1820`'s 1820 boot/sheet data shipped with wrong Senate-class assignment (`scenario1856.ts:86` does a naive assign; the 1856-hardcoded rotation lives at `phaseRunners.ts:3885`), so the validator is now a 2-start-confirmed XS boot-pipeline check — it belongs **inside** `scenarioBoot` (#115), not just adjacent to it. | — (helper); wires into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline (#115) when K4 lands | XS | DH-24 (`pop` 272, 297, 298; **`dem1820` reconfirms** — naive assign `scenario1856.ts:86`, rotation `phaseRunners.ts:3885`) — NEW + RECONFIRMED, HI-CONF (2 start) | ready |
| **QW9** | **DH-27 — `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` validator at dataset/boot import** *(NEW, batch 6)* | A one-helper `validateTraitConflicts(snap, dataset)` that runs `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` (`types.ts:658`) against `snap.politicians[]` at scenario-boot AND against the loaded dataset at `loadStandardDraftClasses` (`standardDraftClasses.ts:13`). Today `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` is consulted only on **trait-ADD events**, not on dataset/boot import — so boot/seed data can ship a pol with both `Integrity` AND `Controversial` (`pop` POST 1139: Quinn). **One pure validator helper.** Same pattern as QW8 — can ship now as a standalone helper, then wire into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline (#115). **★ Batch-10 — reconfirmed:** `dem1820`'s boot/sheet data again shipped trait-conflict + demographic corruption, so this validator belongs inside `scenarioBoot` alongside QW8. | — (helper); wires into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline (#115) when K4 lands | XS | DH-27 (`pop` 1139; `types.ts:658`; **`dem1820` reconfirms**) — NEW + RECONFIRMED | ready |
| **QW10** | **DH-30 — event-scheduler MIN floor (+ spill-to-anytime)** *(NEW, batch 7 — BUG-1's companion)* | The era-event scheduler has a **MAX per half-term but no MIN floor** — over a 20-yr era a 25%-event ≈94% cumulative, but a low-% era can fire *zero* events some playthroughs. `rep1800` POST 2918-2932: *"the limit is a max not a min… which isn't what we discussed."* **Agreed fix: minimum = 20% of the era's max (round down)**; if still none fire (all prereq-gated), **spill to the current 5 generic anytime events**. (A rejected alt — hard year-windows per event — was declined because *"events not happening every playthrough has been explicitly stated to be how the game operates"*, load-bearing for alt-history.) **Same scheduling surface as BUG-1 + divergence #4** — land it alongside QW1 / at E15. Small, additive; no new save shape. | — (pairs with QW1; full scheduling fork resolved at E15) | XS | DH-30 (`rep1800` §A 2918, 2919-2932; companion to BUG-1) — NEW | ready |
| **QW11** | **DH-43 — Vermont home-state mapping (dataset/data fix)** *(NEW, batch 8)* | Vermont-origin pols have **no home-state mapping**, so they cannot relocate "home" (`new1772`). **A pure dataset/data fix:** ensure VT's `homeStates`/region wiring exists (VT enters via the expansion path — `expansionStates.ts` / the statehood pipeline) so VT-origin pols resolve a home state for the relocation/Carpetbagger readers. No engine logic, no save shape — a one-row data correction. Smallest of the batch-8 placements; independent of everything. | — | XS | DH-43 (`new1772`; relates to relocation/Carpetbagger) — NEW | ready |

### Engine track — Phase 0 (keystones)

**`K0 → (K1 ‖ K2 ‖ K3) → K4 ‖ K5`.** After K0, K1/K2/K3 are independent and
parallelizable across PRs; K4 depends on K3. **K5 is a new late-keystone (batch
5)** — sits after K0 + K2, parallel with K3/K4 + federalism (§9.1.3). K2 remains
the single most important keystone (~6× leverage) — **do it first if only one
lands**, because K5 depends on it (most handlers pick from a registry).
**Batch-4: per-era point BANKING (#68) is folded into K3/K4 — not a new item.**
**★ Batch-7: the era-model reframe RE-SPECS K3 + K4 — NOT a new keystone** (§9.1.5
/ divergence #18). `advanceEra` becomes condition-driven (game-state / meter /
TERRITORY, per half-term — no `target` arg); content gates on `game.eraBand` + a
new `territoryOwned` predicate, not the calendar; early sub-bands are content-band
markers. **No new keystones this batch.** See the updated K3 + K4 rows.
**★★ Batch-8: K3 + K4 are now MULTI-SAVE PROVEN — the HIGHEST-confidence large bet
in the roadmap** (§9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump). Two independent saves —
`tea1772` (1772-start) and `rep1800` (1800-start, 28 in-game years apart) — emit
the **identical era-band sequence at identical in-game dates** (game-context #102),
so the content-band model is **settled, not speculative**. **Nothing structural
changes** (the K3/K4 spec was already condition-driven from batch 7); this is a
**confidence/priority raise only** — if engine staffing is scarce, K3/K4 are the
safest era investment to start. **#102's dual era-scoring (per-era winner +
cumulative "winner so far") is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard** — it folds into
K3/K4's per-era point-banking (#68 banks the cumulative total; the win condition is
**DUAL**), NOT a new item. **No new keystones this batch either.**
**★★ Batch-9: K3/K4 are now 3-START-CONFIRMED (1772 + 1800 + 1948) and gain a
TWO-LEVEL refinement + a structured-era-event-data requirement — still NOT a new
keystone, NO re-sequence** (§9.1.5 updated, BINDING). The band model holds across a
THIRD start year (1948, `nuke`), and `nuke` splits it into **two distinct,
separately-fired mechanics that an earlier extractor conflated — BOTH must be built;
do NOT collapse them:** **(a) point-banked Historical Eras** (the #92/#68 content-band
mechanic) that carry **RULE-DELTAS, not just content** (the Era-of-Terror cabinet
rework — region stops mattering, replaced by diversity + faction-balance checks — is
the proof bands change rules); **(b) within-era decade/census boundaries** = a
**separate, schedule-fired** per-decade `AMPU Census` doing **bulk EV reallocation +
wholesale state-bias re-lean + content rotation** — distinct from #68's per-era
bias-table swap (it fires on a 10-yr calendar schedule WITHIN a band). PLUS **K4's
era-event data needs STRUCTURED `evDelta`/census fields (DH-48)** + per-era
completeness validation (the Neocon census/EV-delta events were LOST as free-text
flavor). **Logged correction: "Neocons"/"Corporate Republicans" is a FACTION REBRAND
(~1980), NOT an era band** — do not promote any faction nickname to a Historical Era.
These land **entirely inside K3 (the census-as-a-second-schedule + the rule-delta
hooks) and K4 (the structured era-event data + validators)** — no new keystone, no
re-order. See the updated K3 + K4 rows.
**★ Batch-9: K2 confidence — the per-half-term phase loop is now corroborated at
~25 sub-phases** (`nuke` walks the full 2.1.x→2.10 loop a 4th time across a 1948
campaign), reinforcing that the ActionRegistry (K2) is the right shared host for the
six+ action libraries the loop drives. No scope change; confidence only.
**★ Batch-9: K5 is now LOAD-BEARING, not optional/late (§9.1.3 priority bump,
BINDING).** `nuke` carries the designer's strongest design-intent statement (#114,
§28.12): the **APP is built for 1-human-vs-9-CPU** (multiplayer "goes off the rails";
the points system is for the CPUs, not humans). The app is a **solo adaptation of a
multiplayer game**, so the ENTIRE multiplayer apparatus (party-leader elections,
conversions, kingmaker pairings, committee assignment, cross-faction endorsements,
forced 3rd-party runs, the whole convention) **must be CPU-AI-driven** — and `nuke`
confirms that surface was **entirely UNEXERCISED** by the human playtest (it must be
authored from spec). **This does NOT re-sequence K5** (it still lands after K0 + K2,
parallel with K3/K4 + federalism) — but it raises K5 + the handler suite (E9) from
"force-multiplier" to **the load-bearing system that makes the product playable solo
at all.** Treat the handler suite as a first-class Phase-1 system.
**★★ Batch-10: K4 absorbs the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` PIPELINE — the most-requested
missing item (#115) — at the FRONT of the subsystem queue; still NOT a new keystone,
NO re-sequence** (§9.1.9, BINDING). `dem1820` records that **there are NO documented
rules for CREATING a game** — and verified shipped-state has NO shared boot
abstraction (`startNewGame` `GameContext.tsx:264` switches a literal into hand-
authored builders; `scenario1856.ts:44-214` seats Congress with raw `Math.random`).
So **build one pure `scenarioBoot(BootSheet): FullGameSnapshot` pipeline inside K4's
`BootSheet` schema**, in dependency order **K0 (seed boot rolls) → `scenarioBoot` +
`BootSheet` (with K4) → every scenario becomes a data row** — and build it **WITH the
first new scenario (`scenario1788` / E1), before the third hand-authored copy-paste.**
It is the venue for the XS boot validators (QW8/QW9) + the appointment-ladder
(#115b). See the updated K4 row.
**★ Batch-10: K3/K4 are now 4-START-CONFIRMED** (1772 `tea1772` + 1800 `rep1800` +
**1820 `dem1820`** + 1948 `nuke` all emit the band model — `dem1820`'s draft table
prints "Era of Democracy (1820-1840)" → "Manifest Destiny (1840-1856)", POST 946).
**Confidence bump only — no scope change, no re-order.**
**★ Batch-11: K3/K4's #92 model is now LIVE-EXERCISED end-to-end** — `arkzag` (the same
1820 save run forward to 1840) plays the era/territory content-gate live: the **tariff-
rate-change cooldown to 1836** (POST 928), **Minister-to-Japan creatable by exec action
ONLY in the Manifest-Destiny era** (POST 359), "military academy"/"state university"
gated to later eras (ch5) — AND it surfaces the **concrete defect that the territory
filter is MISSING** (DH-60: "Force Open Trade with Japan" fired with no Pacific port;
"Stubborn Cherokee" without owning the territory, POST 335-340), which lands as the
`requires?: Predicate` era-event gate at **E15 + BUG-1** (reusing K3's `territoryOwned`
predicate). **Confidence bump + DH-60 placement only — no scope change, no re-order, no
keystone move.**

Used by **six+** action libraries (governor/exec/diplomacy/convention-inter-ballot/primary/general — plus the Reconstruction readmission-plan + secession-trigger rows at E3b). **~6× tax if built ad-hoc — the highest-leverage keystone.** **Hard prerequisite for K5** — most CPU handlers pick from a registry library. **Batch 6: the `GameAction<Ctx>` shape gains a `requires?: AmendmentPredicate` field from day one** (divergence #16). One extra field + one filter step in the picker reading `game.amendments.passed`. Canonical instance: the general-election action "Send VP to Shore Up Support" requires the 12th Amendment. Same `requires:` mechanism gates bill catalog entries (income-tax category) + gov action rows; predicate lives at the registry-row level, not the library level. **Cheap if early, expensive if retrofit** across 6 libraries. **Resolve DH-9 (canonical action ability-stat) before the `resolve` signatures harden.** | K0 | S | §6.6 (now confirmed **5 eras**; `hd` adds the Reconstruction/exec rows; `drums` raises the consumer count to 6+; **`pop` POST 951 adds `requires?` field for divergence #16**) + DH-9 — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF (5 era) | ready |
| K3 | **`advanceEra(snap)` — CONDITION-DRIVEN (batch 7, ★ re-specced) — + era-content registry + content-band gating + per-era point BANKING (#68)** | Replace the hard-coded `currentEra = 'federalism'` in `constitutionalConvention.ts:198` with a pure callable transition. **★ Batch-7 reframe (the key change vs. the prior K3 spec): the era boundary is GAME-STATE / METER / TERRITORY-driven, evaluated PER HALF-TERM — NOT a year boundary** (§9.1.5 / divergence #18). `advanceEra` takes **no `target` arg** — it watches an `era.advanceWhen(snap)` condition (the early-republic bands advance on game-state + territory ownership; the Constitution-ratifies trigger at `:198` becomes the **first such condition**, not a hard-coded line). Verified: phases gate by `year % 4` / `year % 2` (`phases.ts:49-59`) — those are **correct for CADENCE and STAY**; there is **no year→era derivation anywhere** (`currentEra` is a plain field), so this is a **generalization of the one existing trigger, not a rewrite**. **★ Gate all content (bills / era-events / draftees / bias-table) on `game.eraBand` + a NEW `territoryOwned` predicate, NOT literal year** — un-owned-land content is invalid (Louisiana-born pols un-playable until LA is owned; this is the mechanism that *forces* `rep1800`'s ~30-yr content lag). **One new `territoryOwned(snap, requirement)` predicate** (a `Predicate` variant + one `evalPredicate` case at `eraGraph.ts:12`), **three consumers** (bill catalog, era-event walker, draft pool — the draft pool also excludes pols whose state/territory is un-owned/unorganized, = §27.5's gate). **The bank-and-zero boot pipeline (#68) fires AT the content-band boundary wherever it lands on the calendar:** bank the running per-era `Faction.score` into `eraPointBanks?: Record<Era,…>` + zero the running total, pay end-of-era awards, re-run pre-turn phases (2.1.x→2.3.1), swap content pools (card-pool + per-era card-count rescale, draft profile, SCOTUS set, nation renames, party-formation, **per-era state-bias table wholesale**). The per-era banks **sum toward the (open) cross-era win total**. Lift the **5** `ERA_GRAPH_1772` spots in `eraGraph.ts` (`:4,:73,:113,:148,:164`) to `ERA_GRAPHS: Record<Era, GraphNode[]>`. **No new top-level field beyond an optional `game.eraBand` marker (can reuse `currentEra`).** **RECONCILES #68 point-banking + §26 BootSheet boot model + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE era system** (debt #5/#9 dissolve here). **★ Batch-8 — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN (HIGHEST confidence, no scope change):** the content-band sequence is corroborated by TWO independent saves (`tea1772` 1772-start + `rep1800` 1800-start, 28 in-game years apart, identical bands at identical dates — #102), so the condition-driven model is settled, not speculative. **The per-era banks feed the DUAL win-condition scoreboard (#102): a per-era winner AND a cumulative "winner so far"** — the bank-and-zero already computes both (the running total is the cumulative scoreboard), so this is a labeling/exposure concern, NOT new banking logic. **★ Batch-9 — TWO-LEVEL refinement (3-START-CONFIRMED; §9.1.5), still inside K3:** the era model has **two distinct, separately-fired mechanics — build BOTH, do NOT collapse them.** **(a) The point-banked Historical Eras (the `advanceWhen` content-bands above) carry RULE-DELTAS, not just content** — the Era-of-Terror cabinet rework (region stops mattering → diversity + faction-balance checks) proves a band can change *rules*, so the boundary pipeline must support per-band rule-delta hooks, not only pool/bias swaps. **(b) A SEPARATE per-decade `AMPU Census` mechanic, schedule-fired (NOT a band boundary):** every ~10 in-game years it does **bulk EV reallocation vs the prior census + wholesale state-bias re-lean (Blue5..Tossup..Red5) + content rotation** (draft pool / lobby cards / era-activated industries) — distinct from #68's per-era bias swap (which fires at a band boundary). The census needs a per-state population model + House cap (parking-lot DH-49) before it can compute EV deltas. **Era CONTENT (events/SCOTUS docket) fires on yet a THIRD clock — a scripted ~5%/phase schedule decoupled from in-game history (#109)** — reinforcing §6.4: bands gate on game-state, the census fires on a 10-yr schedule, content fires on its own clock. **Logged correction: "Neocons" is a faction-rebrand at a census boundary, NOT a band — do not model it as one.** | K0 | M | gap #2 (`fed` 11,518; `modern` 1080,1172; `hd` I-12, 6679-6816) + **#92 (`rep1800` §B 4329, 5082, 5255-5256, 5602, 5828-5837; §A open-Q 1)** + **#102 multi-save proof + dual-scoring (`tea1772` 21/62/91/130/153 + `rep1800` 92/6201)** + **#106/#109 two-level + content-clock (`nuke` §27.1/§28.9)** + **#92 4th-start corroboration (`dem1820` POST 946 — "Era of Democracy (1820-1840)" → "Manifest Destiny (1840-1856)")** + #68 (banking) + divergence #18, debt #5/#9 — CARRIED + RE-SPECCED, **4-START-CONFIRMED (1772/1800/1820/1948), HIGHEST-CONF (4 independent saves / 7 era)** | ready |

New files: `scenario1788.ts`, `factions1788.ts`, `states1788.ts`. Per-(faction, era) `FACTION_DRAFT_PROFILES`. **Era-keyed tables:** rookie draft-grant (#69: 3 traits + 3 alt-states; reverse-PV order + pick-position bonuses); amendment-ratifier/threshold stub (#64); **double-points-issues per era (#87 — Populism: Climate Crisis + Immigration); procedural-pol-gen `startYear` per era (#90 — Populism: 2020).** **Batch 6 — the `BootSheet<{era, startYear, factions, sittingGovernment, stateRoster, decks, …}>` schema.** Three documented mid-government boots (1788 designed / 1856 shipped / 2012 designed) share ONE shape: pre-built 5 Blue + 5 Red faction roster + per-faction archetype politicians + era-tuned ideology/interest/lobby decks + sitting government keyed to start year + **state roster keyed to `{era, startYear}`, NOT era alone** (same `modern` enum has BOTH the 50+DC fresh-boot roster AND the 53-state Wyoming-Rule continuation roster) + EXPLICITLY EMPTY baselines (no faction leaders at boot, no career-track pols, no inherited PV/legacy/Kingmaker pairs) + the generic-Major-candidate fallback for the first primary (1 command + matching ideology + matching interest/lobby). **Build the schema ONCE, instantiate per era.** Era identity is **data configuration**, not a code path (R1's "Trumpism" deck is the seed configuration of one faction, not a "Trumpism mechanic"). **★ Batch 7 — the era-content registry is the HOME of the CONTENT-BAND model** (§9.1.5 / divergence #18): each era is a `{bills, eraEvents, draftees, biasTable, advanceWhen}` record (the `advanceWhen` condition + the `territoryOwned` content-gate live here, consumed by K3). **The early-republic sub-bands (Republicanism / Democracy / Manifest-Destiny) are content-band MARKERS on the game-state gate, NOT new enum values** unless rule tables genuinely diverge from `nationalism` (open Q; tech-lead's call: **markers first** — cheapest, no exhaustiveness cascade; the shipped 4-value enum stays, `gilded`/`progressive` remain the two values K4 adds because *those* have divergent rule tables). **★ Batch-8 hard guard (NEGATIVE RESULT): K4 adds EXACTLY `gilded` + `progressive` — NO "future" era.** No ingested thread reaches a post-Gilded/post-modern era (`tea1772`, titled "…to future," stalls at 1874 mid-Gilded; `hd`/`drums`/`pop` top out at Gilded/Progressive/Populism), so there is **no source and no build target** for a future era — do not add an enum value for one. The **per-era state-bias table swaps in wholesale at the boundary** (#68 step 6 — pairs with DH-34's static-bias decision: ship static per-band tables). Wire **QW8 Senate-class verifier (DH-24)** + **QW9 `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` validator (DH-27)** into the boot pipeline. **★ Batch-9 — STRUCTURED era-event-data requirement (DH-48, §28.9), lands here:** era-event content rows must carry a **STRUCTURED `evDelta`/census field (not free-text)** + **per-era completeness validation** so a 10-yr census reallocation (K3 level (b)) always fires — the whole Neocon census/EV-delta event block was LOST in the source spreadsheet *because* the events were free-text flavor (stored alphabetically-by-era; EV-change events lacked the token "EV" → unsearchable → mis-moved to the wrong band). The typed field lives on K4's era-content registry; the completeness check lives at the dataset-build validators (sibling to QW8/QW9). **★ Batch-9 — `scenario1948` is a FOURTH `BootSheet` boot shape** (alongside 1772 / 1856 / 2012): a Cold-War mid-government boot (Truman/Barkley seated, **48 states** with AK/HI arriving as statehood bills, 5R/5B with **Dixiecrats INSIDE Blue + Reagan-a-Democrat** [the realignment start], the full modern+Cold-War cabinet incl. **Ambassador to the USSR**, a ~6-yr era→year clock offset). The schema is unchanged — `scenario1948` is one more instantiation; the *content* instantiation itself is the Phase-2 capstone E30. **★ Batch-10 — the shared `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` PIPELINE is PROMOTED to the front of the subsystem queue (#115 / §9.1.9), and it FOLDS INTO this `BootSheet` schema — it is NOT a new keystone.** `dem1820` records the **single most-requested missing item in the forum's own words: there are NO documented rules for CREATING a game.** GA setup is improvised — verified shipped-state has **NO shared boot abstraction**: `startNewGame` (`GameContext.tsx:264`) switches on a literal into hand-authored `build1772Scenario`/`build1856Scenario`; `scenario1856.ts:44-214` seats Congress with raw `Math.random`, naive Senate-class assignment, full `EV-2` House reps, a 47-field `GameState` literal; no career-track seeding, no Command-stripping. So **build ONE pure `scenarioBoot(BootSheet): FullGameSnapshot` pipeline** that canonicalizes the deterministic setup algorithm the GA invents per game: the **strip-Command decision** (the contested "≤40 boot pols w/o a job lose Command" house rule — `dem1820` POST 82; a boot-pipeline policy), the **inaugural career-track seed from the LAST-3 draft classes** (the 1820/1816/1812 classes, POST 28 — pairs with DH-25), **era-keyed industry init for new states** (NOT 0, POST 532), **Senate-class assignment + the QW8 verifier**, **vacant-seat appointment-fill via the appointment-ladder** (#115b), and the **5+5 ideology ladder + era-tuned decks**. **Dependency order is LEGIBLE: K0 (seeds the boot rolls — drop the raw `Math.random` Senate/Congress seeding) → `scenarioBoot` + `BootSheet` (built HERE, with K4) → every scenario (1772/1788/1820/1856/1948/2012) becomes a DATA ROW fed through the one pipeline.** **★ Build it WITH the first new scenario — `scenario1788` (Phase-1 #1 / E1) — BEFORE the third hand-authored copy-paste of a scenario** (1772 + 1856 ship hand-authored today; `scenario1788` is the third — author the shared pipeline instead of copy-pasting `build1856Scenario` a third time).

### Engine track — Phase 1 (subsystems, dependency-ordered)

Ordered exactly per tech-lead §9.6 to minimize rework. The federalism /
early-republic epic (E1) is one spine; **E3b (Civil War / Reconstruction) is the
second — it completes the already-shipped 1856 scenario** and sits right after
generic war (E3) + K2, **not** behind federalism or the modern tail (§9.1.2).
**Batch-7 additions: E4 folds in the 12A legislature-elector toggle; new E4b is
the early-republic cluster** (slavery-flag+Cohens / Second Bank+Bank War /
statehood-by-bill+territory-gate); **new E5b (ideology-as-circle) is the
foundational central-helper refactor placed early** (§9.1.7). Rows **E6–E8** are
the **NEAR-TERM cross-cutting items the modern thread pulled forward** — not
modern-only. **E9 is the CPU handler suite — 15 lightweight PRs once K5 lands;
★★ E9 handler #2 is the gate on E3b's Reconstruction readmission half (DH-29).**
**Batch-8 fold-ins (no new rows, no re-order):** **#100** SCOTUS-overturns-an-
amendment + amendable-threshold → E5 (amendments) + E25 (SCOTUS docket); **#103**
presidential-vote modifier stack + era-issue list + **DH-42** meter-vs-lean balance
→ E20 (election-math/scoring); **#104** lone-ideology convention exploit → E9
handler 9e (guard); **#105** stat-collapse → forced resignation → E10b

multiplayer/parking lot.
**★ Batch-9 fold-ins (no new rows, no re-order — CONFIDENCE + NEGATIVE-SCOPE + small
placements):** the "Cold War" is **NOT a new epic** — it is **E3 (generic war)
RELABELED + E12 (diplomacy) + content (data on K4)** (§9.1.8). The two REAL items
under the label are already on the roadmap and gain hard build-holes: **E3 must
RESOLVE — DH-47: wars NEVER end today (Korea ran ~2 decades) → build a real
resolution/peace path (couples to DH-12 white-peace) + ideally army/navy/air
BRANCHES** (army generals command navies today); and **E12 (diplomacy) is the real
modern foreign subsystem — 8 relation meters + ambassador actions + DH-46 downward
pressure (the US ends up allied with everyone) + DH-45 fix the USSR-collapse trigger
chain (stalls at a ~5% gate) + a Cold-War ≤Neutral cap on USSR/China.** **E16 extends
to CREATE-AND-ABOLISH cabinet seats** (DOE/DHS created, **Postmaster General
ABOLISHED**, HEW split — `Legislation.abolishesCabinetSeat?`). The **modern
election/institutional layer** folds into existing rows: **#105** stat-collapse →
forced resignation + **DH-54** impeachment/VP-vacancy/succession ruleset →
**E10b/E29** (DH-54 author-before-build); **legislated variable SCOTUS size +
excess-not-replaced (#112)** → **E25**; **#108** gradual 4-lever realignment +
**#110** modern election machine → **E20/E23**; **#113** Era-of-Terror content →
E30 (data). DH placements: **DH-50/53** era-event scheduling + bill-catalog → E15 /
E2; **DH-52** landslide-margin-cap (no close elections) → E20 balance; **DH-51**
modern pols OVERPOWERED/recency-biased → the dataset pipeline (`scripts/`); **DH-55**
3rd-party region-weighted PV + engine-is-2-party-hard-wired → E26; **DH-57**
convention holes → E10 / handler 9e. **`scenario1948`** continuation-boot content →
**E30** (a 4th `BootSheet` shape).
**★ Batch-10 fold-ins (no new rows, no re-order — PROMOTION + decision-gating +
small placements):** **#115 scenario-boot pipeline** → **K4** (the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)`
pipeline, PROMOTED to the front of the subsystem queue, built with `scenario1788`/**E1**
before the third hand-authored copy; the venue for **QW8/QW9** validators + the

**QW8** / the boot pipeline, XS; **#55** focus-Rep `(EV−2)/5` + seat-locked incumbency →
**E7** (scaling-wall b) + **E28** (census epic), M; **#59** statehood→sectional-crisis →
**E3b** (b) additive at `admitState`/**E21**, S; **#115b** appointment-ladder +
replacement-gains timing → boot/appointment rules (**K4**/**E16**, pairs with **DH-25**),
XS. **#92 era-band model** → 4-START-CONFIRMED (**K3/K4** confidence bump). **DH-36**
(2nd GA-burnout death) → NOT a row; the prioritization ARGUMENT for the upkeep-reducing
items (#115, #55, E7, K5/E9).
**★ Batch-11 fold-ins (ONE new small epic, two re-scopes, one fork resolved, two
bug-folds — NO re-sequence, NO new keystone, NO keystone moves):** **#116 economic
engine** → **NEW small epic `E4c`** (deps **E2 + E6 + E4b(b)**; built EMERGENT via a

top-to-bottom buildability), S. **#119 amendment lifecycle** → **RE-SCOPES E5**
(propose→committee→floor→governor-ratify→active + active-amendment-blocks-a-legislation-
class + un-bundleable), +S. **#61 succession** → **RE-SCOPES E10b** (VP-succeeds →
fill-VP [E5-gated] → acting-president action-divert roll + trait side-effect; the kill
trigger already SHIPS at `anytimeEvents.ts:232`/`phaseRunners.ts:2449`; the
line-of-succession/impeachment half stays parking-lot **DH-54**). **#51** → **PROMOTED
to E23 `ready`** (the `arkzag` 4-step reshuffle + −100/waiver, verbatim `drums`); the
**±3 cap is UNCONDITIONALLY ready and ships with E6 (QW3)** — only **#18 state-scope**
stays Decision-gated, joined by a **NEW delegate-class fork** (→ **E10** delegate sub-PR
+ **E24**). **DH-59** relations under-floor clamp → **E12** (XS, folds in with the
9-point scale). **DH-60** era-event territory/asset prereq → **E15 + BUG-1** (S, a
`requires?: Predicate` reusing K3's `territoryOwned`). **Corroborations** (multi-campaign
tags, not rows): #13/#111 → **E10**, #11 → **E14**, #44/#16 → **E4**, #52 → **E25**,
#92 → **K3/K4** (now LIVE-exercised). **DH-36** → still NOT a row; the meta-signal
FLIPS POSITIVE (no GA-burnout this thread — a **3-thread automation-reduces-upkeep
signal**, strengthens #115/#55/E7/K5/E9).

| # | Item | Scope | Depends on | Size | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | **Federalism / early-republic era epic (`scenario1788` content + the early-republic subsystems)** | A high-value epic — **batch 7 widens it to the federalism + early-republic (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) content band.** Era-event spine (Compromise of 1790, Hamiltonian program, Whiskey/Fries, French-Rev wars, Louisiana Purchase), party-formation events (~1792; `Party.formedYear`/`eraName`), 10-faction roster + nickname relabel, Mod/Cons draft profile, federalism SCOTUS set (`scotusFederalism.ts`). **Must land with BUG-1 (QW1) + QW10 (DH-30 min-floor).** **The early-republic subsystems this band needs land at Phase-1 #4 (E4 12A elector toggle) + #4b (E4b slavery-flag+Cohens / Second Bank+Bank War / statehood-by-bill+territory-gate)** — folded out into their own rows below so they sequence after their keystones (E4 needs E5; E4b needs the SCOTUS docket + K2 + the dynamic seat list).

## Later / parking lot

Bigger, fuzzier, deferred, or **needs-design-before-build**.

### Author-before-build (design tasks — a PM/design job, not a `/build-feature` run)

These have **no rules to build to yet**; the rules must be **authored first**, then
they fold into the engine row noted. **★ Batch 9 adds TWO NEW author-before-build
items → 12 total:** **DH-49** — a **POPULATION MODEL + House cap** (the one
genuinely-NEW infrastructure item this batch: the per-decade census EV-reallocation
[K3 level (b)] and the Wyoming-Rule apportionment [E28] are un-implementable without
a per-state population model + a House-size cap, and **neither exists today** —
`State.electoralVotes` is a static seed; author it OR size it into the
census/apportionment epic E28 as its first sub-task); and **DH-54** — an
**impeachment / VP-vacancy / succession ruleset** (never in the rules doc across 3
campaigns; corroborates DH-33; folds into E10b + E29). **Batch 8 added ONE:**
**DH-41** — the general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade (UNBUILT,
`vcczar`-deferred; folds into the SCOTUS docket E25 once decided). **Batch 7 added
ONE:** DH-33 impeachment-ruleset rewrite (folds into E29) — plus a separate
**roadmap DECISION** (DH-34 static-era-biases — *resolved: ship static*; see the
note below, it is **not** an author task). **Batch 6 added ONE BLOCKER:** DH-25
career-track bootstrap (3-yr-stale design discussion; **BLOCKS Phase-2 modern
scenarios E30 + E31**). **Batch 5 added six items:** contingent-election rules
(#10/#84 is the biggest), §25.9 Iron-Fist split, DH-12 white-peace, DH-13
faithless-elector cap, DH-14 era-aware bill ideology, DH-15 small-state action
multiplier. **Batch 10 adds NO new author-before-build items** — its one new gap
(#115) is a buildable pipeline folded into K4 (not a rules-authoring hole), and the
**#115b** appointment-ladder is an XS item owned inside K4/E16 (it depends on the
existing DH-25 career-track-eligibility call, listed there). **Batch 11 adds NO new
author-before-build items either** — its two new gaps (#116 economic engine → E4c,
#119 amendment lifecycle → E5) are buildable subsystems, #61's succession ENGINE is
ready-to-build (its line-of-succession/impeachment half is the ALREADY-LISTED **DH-54**),
and DH-59/DH-60 are sized bug-folds (→ E12 / E15+BUG-1). **Total author-before-build
items: still 12** (DH-1, #10/#84, §25.9, DH-12, DH-13, DH-14, DH-15, DH-25, DH-33,
DH-41, **DH-49**, **DH-54** — the latter now also gating E10b's line-of-succession
half). **Decision-gated category — held at 2 by batch 11** (batch 10 introduced it
with #52 + #18/#51): the **#51 enthusiasm-SHIFT fork was RESOLVED** (`arkzag` 4-step →
E23, leaves the category), and a **NEW delegate-class fork ARRIVED** (AI-allocator vs
player-rigged), so the two remaining picks are **#52 player-controlled SCOTUS** and
**#18-state-scope + the delegate-class fork** (both election-engine). See the
**"Decision-gated"** subsection below.

- **DH-1 — filibustered "MUST-pass" bill remedy (needs-design).** A required
  bill filibustered to death has no rulebook remedy; the GM improvised a
  4-leader special-committee auto-pass with a per-day "shutdown" penalty clock.
  **Author the deadlock-resolution rule** (forced-compromise vs shutdown-clock
  vs fallback auto-pass), then build into **E14c (filibuster) / E29**. — DH-1,
  debt #21 (`modern` 640-716).
- **Divergence #10 / #84 — Contingent-election rules don't exist (NEW, batch 5).**
  GM Tyler invented **5 candidate rulesets** to settle 1848 tie (`drums` POSTS
  472-474): party-line state vote / faction-first then party / Speaker-Min-
  Leader-controls-state / momentum+swaying / state modifiers. All 5 favored
  Fillmore; GM picked #4 (momentum) to keep play moving. **Author rules
  BEFORE build:** (a) top-2 vs top-3 (DH-6: GM used top-2); (b) outgoing-vs-
  incoming Congress (GM nebulous, used incoming POSTS 4467-4475); (c) deadlock
  side-effects (EBR POST 5250: Controversial gain on elected Pres + 50/50 Dom
  Stab hit); plus 17 state delegations for Pres + 33 Senate for VP (POST 810).
  **Bundles with hd #62 at E10b.** — #10/#84/DH-6 (`drums` 472-474, 810,
  4467-4475, 5176, 5217-5221, 5250).
- **§25.9 — Iron-Fist exact split shape (NEW, batch 5).** The 6 office-keyed
  child trait names + cascade rules need a designer call before build. §25.9
  lists 6 candidate effects (PL+Honest-Gov-maxed gov control; Sen Maj Leader
  vote forcing; President officer-fire / SCOTUS-compel / challenger-stifle;
  Loans-from-Wealthy + IF PL gov takeover; Convention PL unilateral threshold;
  mid-war military replacement) but the **exact names** and **what cascades to
  what** are open. Author the split, then build **E17**. — gap #77 + §25.9
  (`drums` 2433-7364).
- **DH-12 — White-peace rules MISSING from the war system (NEW, batch 5).**
  Tyler (`drums` POSTS 6533-6541): *"There are, in fact, no rules about white
  peace"* — had to dig up old treaty docs. **Author the spec** (Moderate
  Implementation Pres+Sec State+Sec War; 75% −1 Party Pref; −100 Mil-Industry;
  −500 Expansionists; −500 President; return to antebellum status quo), then
  fold into **E3** (generic war) / **E3b** (Civil-War readmission). — DH-12.
- **DH-13 — Faithless-elector trigger cap (NEW, batch 5).** Current trigger
  fires "whenever winner's state has the other party's ideology enthusiasm
  maxed" — over-aggressive (`drums` POSTS 466, 469-471, 2912, 4441): 1876
  produced 22 faithless from Cobb + 12 from Fremont; 1892 produced 8 Whig →
  232-232 tie → House contingent; 1900 had an 8-elector defection. **Author
  the documented + capped trigger** (e.g. max-N per state + state-modifier
  table) + the EBR deadlock side-effect rule (POST 5250). Folds into **E26**
  3rd-party or a per-(state) cap inside the EC tally. — DH-13.
- **DH-14 — Bill ideology impacts not era-aware (NEW, batch 5).** Matt
  (`drums` POSTS 6691, 6878, 6912): Mods need to be removed from the
  negative-points side of Women's Suffrage in 1916 — should be era-sensitive.
  Tyler agreed. **Equal Voting Rights for Women never passes** (60.5% / 63.6%
  short of 2/3): GM: *"This amendment will never pass in a game with CPUs."*
  **Author the era-keyed bill ideology impact tables**, then fold into the bill
  catalog (E14 / E20). — DH-14.
- **DH-15 — Small/large-state action-impact multiplier UNCODIFIED (batch 5).**
  Tyler (`drums` POSTS 6676-6680): *"Since RI is a small state he would only
  succeed on impacting the meter at 2.5% [half of 5%]; large states double."*
  In playtest sheets ("Effects Meters?" column) but **not codified in the gov
  actions section of the rulebook**. **Author the multiplier rule + the
  small/large-state classification table**, then fold into **E11** (governor
  actions). — DH-15.
- **DH-25 — Career-track bootstrap unresolved (NEW, batch 6 — BLOCKS Phase-2
  modern scenarios E30 + E31).** Lars (`pop` POST 33): *"we've legit been
  having this discussion for almost three years now and somehow we've yet to
  change the rulebook or the game."* For a mid-game boot, the question is
  "which existing pols start on career tracks (Foreign / Military /
  Industrial / Academic / Bureaucrat) at boot?" — and no canonical rule
  exists. **Zagnut's houserule on the table:** anyone drafted in 1996+ goes
  onto one track each (POST 31). Rodja hand-populated by GM ad-hoc (POST 38,
  50). **Author the bootstrap rule before `scenario1948` (E30) or
  `scenario2012` (E31) ships** — both are gated on it. **The single biggest
  parking-lot item from batch 6.** **★ Batch-10 — `dem1820` reconfirms + sharpens
  this AND surfaces the SELF-CONTRADICTION (#86/DH-25/DH-56):** the 1820 GA seeded the
  **inaugural career-track from the LAST-3 DRAFT CLASSES** (1820/1816/1812, POST 28) —
  a concrete bootstrap variant for the rule to choose among — and exposed that **2.1
  says career-track pols "can't run or be appointed" while many sections pull them by
  election/appointment** (the GA ruled to ignore the bar — a friction point in the
  DH-36 burnout). **Author ONE coherent career-track-eligibility rule here too** (run/
  appoint allowed or not), since the boot pipeline (#115) and the appointment-ladder
  (#115b) both depend on it. **★ The appointment-ladder (#115b) PAIRS WITH this item
  (XS, into the boot/appointment rules):** when a seat must be appointment-filled at
  boot, the deterministic ladder is **own-party-not-CT → own-party-CT → opposite-not-CT
  → opposite-CT → generate** (the order the GA improvised); it lives in `scenarioBoot`
  (#115 / K4) once this CT-eligibility rule is authored. — DH-25 (+ #115b appointment-
  ladder; `dem1820` POST 28; #86/DH-56 CT-eligibility self-contradiction).
- **DH-33 — Impeachment ruleset broken/outdated (NEW, batch 7).** The
  impeachment mini-flow runs but the canonical rules are flagged
  non-functional / improvised — `rep1800` corroborates `hd`'s "impeachment
  super outdated and doesn't work" across a **2nd campaign** (an Integrity
  justice got accused of bribery — nonsensical; only **resignation** avoids
  the DomStab/Honest-Gov drop). **Author the impeachment rewrite before
  building it into E29** (modern legislative depth). — DH-33 (`rep1800` §A
  465-474; §B 3594, 3620; corroborates `hd` DH-14-impeachment).
- **★ DH-41 — general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade (NEW, batch 8
  — the headline batch-8 author-before-build item).** `tea1772` POST 124-126: a
  spectator argued **Prigg v. Pennsylvania** should auto-void the Fugitive Slave
  Act; `vcczar` **deferred** — *"V will need to think about it."* This is
  **distinct from the *built* strike-a-single-law** (`tea1772` POST 770-784) **and
  from #100's overturn-an-amendment-on-review** — it is the **general cascade**: a
  ruling that *contradicts a law on the books*. **Today a contradicting ruling
  leaves the law operative.** A genuinely undesigned policy: does the ruling
  void/neuter the conflicting law, or leave it operative (the current default)?
  **Author the cascade policy before building it**, then fold into the SCOTUS
  docket (**E25**). Cross-refs §24.4's *Pollock*→income-tax coupling (which IS a
  designed gate, already handled at E5/E25). — DH-41 (`tea1772` 124-126; cf. the
  built 770-784).
- **★ DH-49 — a POPULATION MODEL + House cap (NEW, batch 9 — the ONE genuinely-new
  infrastructure item this batch).** The per-decade census EV-reallocation (level
  (b) of the era model, K3 / §28.9) and the Wyoming-Rule apportionment (E28 /
  #34/#55) are **un-implementable without a real per-state population model + a
  House-size cap** — and **neither exists today** (`State.electoralVotes` is a
  static seed; there is **no population field** anywhere). Unlike most batch-9 items
  (which relabel/extend existing work), this is **new infrastructure.** **Author the
  population model + House cap before build, OR size it INTO the census/apportionment
  epic (E28) as its first sub-task.** Once it exists, the K3 census level (b) and the
  E28 Wyoming-Rule recompute both consume it. — DH-49 (`nuke` §28.9; the census +
  Wyoming-Rule items E28 / K3 depend on it).
- **★ DH-54 — impeachment / VP-vacancy / succession ruleset was NEVER in the rules
  doc (NEW, batch 9 — corroborates DH-33 across a THIRD campaign).** `nuke` (§28.5):
  there is **no impeachment trigger** (a Watergate-analog went undetected → pure
  upside) and **VP-vacancy fill was "made up as we go."** This corroborates
  `rep1800`'s DH-33 ("impeachment super outdated and doesn't work") + `hd` across a
  third campaign — the ruleset has never been written down. **Author the impeachment
  + VP-vacancy-fill + succession ruleset before building** the institutional layer:
  it gates the configurable line of succession + the acting-president gate (**E10b**)
  and the impeachment rewrite (**E29**). Pairs with #105 (stat-collapse→forced-
  resignation, the one *built-able* succession trigger). Distinct from DH-33 only in
  scope (DH-33 = "impeachment is broken"; DH-54 = "impeachment AND succession were
  never specified") — treat them as one author task. — DH-54 (`nuke` §28.5; cf.
  DH-33 `rep1800`).

### Decision-gated (a HUMAN design pick — NOT ready-to-build, NOT a planner call)

**A HUMAN must choose the canonical model first; the build cannot pick one on its own.
These are NOT ready-to-build and are NOT author-before-build holes (rules EXIST — two
or more competing models; a human must pick), then the item folds into the engine row
noted.** (Distinct from "Roadmap decisions" below, which are tech-lead/planner calls
already made.) **★ Batch 11 — one fork RESOLVED, one fork ARRIVES → still 2 items:**
the **#51 enthusiasm-SHIFT fork was RESOLVED** (the `arkzag` 4-step rule, verbatim
`drums` → **E23, `ready`**), so **#51 LEAVES this category** and only **#18's
meter→election STATE-SCOPE sub-question remains** (the cap is now un-gated, ships with
E6 — see QW3/E23); and a **NEW delegate-class fork ARRIVES** (AI-allocator-by-EV-
formula vs player-rigged). Count holds at **2: (1) #52 player-controlled SCOTUS, (2)
the merged #18-state-scope + the NEW delegate-class fork** (two open picks, both
election-engine).

- **★ #52 — Player-controlled SCOTUS: ALL-CPU vs PLAYER-CONTROLLABLE-WITH-
  RESTRICTIONS vs TRAIT-GATED (DECISION-GATED).** `dem1820` runs a **LIVE player-
  controlled court** (votes by-ideology-chart, but **delay/dismiss is a player action**;
  dismiss only Gov-Action cases; must hear ≥1 per term) — which **RE-ENABLES the
  control `pop` POST 479-480 said vcczar DISABLED** mid-design. So the three live
  models are: (a) **all-CPU-by-ideology** (the shipped intent per `pop`), (b)
  **player-controllable-with-restrictions** (the `dem1820` live model), (c)
  **trait-gated** control (Iron-Fist/Manipulative compel only). **A human must pick.**
  **★ BUT THE SCOTUS DOCKET DATA STRUCTURE IS NEEDED EITHER WAY** — regardless of who
  drives the votes, the per-term case docket must exist: it lives in
  `src/data/scotusCases<Era>.ts` + a `GameState.scotusDocket` ledger (the shipped court
  is a COIN-FLIP — `phaseRunners.ts:3397,3648` — with no docket and no player surface).
  **So E25 (the SCOTUS docket, → Phase-2 #25) is NOT blocked by this fork — build the
  docket; the player-vs-CPU surface is what waits on the pick.** Verified shipped:
  `phaseRunners.ts:3397,3648` (coin-flip), no docket. — #52 (`dem1820` delay/dismiss-
  only live court vs `pop` POST 479-480 disabled; docket → **E25**).
- **★ #18 — Meter→election STATE SCOPE: EVERY-STATE-UNLESS-PENALIZED vs
  IDEOLOGY-LEANING-STATES-ONLY (DECISION-GATED — NARROWED in batch 11).** Batch 10 had
  this as the 3-way **#18/#51** fork; the `arkzag` continuation **RESOLVED the #51
  enthusiasm-SHIFT step** (the 4-step rule, verbatim `drums`, NOT Ted's "every state"
  nor Matt's "primaries only" — now **E23, `ready`**) and **un-gated the ±3 cap**
  (ships with E6). So what REMAINS is purely the **STATE-APPLICATION step of the
  meter→election map**: does a per-ideology-card bonus apply to **every state unless that
  state penalizes the ideology** (Ted's reading) or only to **ideology-leaning states**
  (V's)? The `arkzag` model expresses the shifts per ideology card and leaves the
  state-application to the meter→election map (#18) — so this is the last open piece. **A
  human must pick.** Verified shipped: `calcStateVote` (`phaseRunners.ts:3685`, score
  `:3709-3711`) applies enthusiasm **UNIFORMLY with no per-state penalty** today.
  **Folds into E20/E23 (election math / enthusiasm engine) once chosen** — and does NOT
  block the E23 enthusiasm-SHIFT engine, which is `ready`. — #18 (`arkzag` resolves the
  #51 half → E23; `dem1820` POST 569/575/618 + `arkzag` ch15 POST 1230 state-scope fork;
  shipped `phaseRunners.ts:3685,:3709-3711`).
- **★ NEW (batch 11) — Convention DELEGATE-CLASS assignment: AI-ALLOCATOR-BY-EV-FORMULA
  vs PLAYER-RIGGED (DECISION-GATED).** `arkzag` exposes a GA-vs-designer fork: **Zagnut
  moved delegate-class assignment to AI-AUTO** (a published 5-category EV×1..×4 formula,
  "eliminates self-dealing + saves time", ch3 POST 276), but **Ted holds delegate-
  RIGGING is INTENDED design** — and the **1840 convention REVERTED to human-set
  classes** (ch32 POST 2466). So the two live models are: (a) an **AI/deterministic
  delegate allocator** (the EV×category formula, no player input), or (b) a
  **player-set/rigged allocator** (rigging as a feature). **A human must pick which is
  canonical** before the **delegate-apportionment sub-PR of E10** (the CPU delegate
  engine) and before **E24's primary-group apportionment** consume it — but it does
  **NOT block the rest of E10** (the ballot loop / inter-ballot library / platform/VP
  sub-PRs proceed; only the apportionment sub-PR waits). Pairs with #13/#71/#104
  (the lone-ideology delegate-sweep handling). — #13 delegate-class fork (`arkzag` ch3
  POST 276 AI-auto vs ch32 POST 2466 human-set; → E10 delegate sub-PR + E24).

### Roadmap decisions (a planner CALL, not an author task)

- **★ DH-34 — Static era-biases vs. policy-reactive biases → the Red-unwinnable
  "AMPU 2.0" hole (NEW, batch 7). DECISION: ship static biases.** The single
  most-repeated `rep1800` complaint: `State.bias` is a static per-era table that
  does **not** react to policy (abolish slavery → the South should swing Red, but
  doesn't), so the Federalists are acknowledged-**unwinnable 1800–1840** (Blue
  142-0 House by 1804; Jefferson 179-0 / 197-15) and players quit. The GM +
  designer's own stance: dynamic/policy-reactive biases are *"too complicated /
  not part of the AMPU vision… maybe AMPU 2.0."* **The planner must DECIDE: ship
  static (accept the imbalance — the cheap path the forum itself chose) vs. invest
  in policy-reactive biases (a large new system).** **Tech-lead's call, adopted
  here: SHIP STATIC for now** (it is the forum's own stance and the imbalance is a
  known-accepted property); revisit only if balance becomes a release blocker.
  **This means K4's per-era state-bias table swaps in wholesale at the boundary
  (#68 step 6) but does NOT react to policy.** Pairs with #21/#34 (bias as a
  field) + DH-29's solo-balance theme. — DH-34 (`rep1800` §A 22, 350, 720-747,
  1328-1335, 2444-2457, 2641, 2711-2713). **NOT an author-before-build item — it
  is resolved (ship static); no rules to write.**

### Balance dials (fold into the named subsystem; no standalone build)

- **DH-4** — cap "Extend Credit to all nations" → **E12** (diplomacy library).
- **DH-11** — apparent Dem 3rd-party bias → **E26**; inelastic lobby cards →
  **E19** (card algorithm).
- **DH-16** — reapportionment cap 435 likely never triggers in normal play
  (POST 5352: ~year 2000 before the cap binds). No fix needed; flag for the
  apportionment recompute (E28). — batch 5.
- **DH-26 — 3rd-party VP "same traits" rule is prohibitive (NEW, batch 6).**
  An independent presidential run requires *"a VP with the same traits"* as
  the presidential candidate (Lars `pop` POST 945-947), making 3rd-party
  tickets **nearly impossible** in practice. **Pairs with DH-11** (Dem
  3rd-party structural bias). Both 3rd-party design holes are addressed
  simultaneously inside **E26** (third-party trigger): relax the trait
  constraint AND fix the structural bias. → **E26**.
- **DH-28 — "Repeal climate crisis" tag completeness is gameable (NEW,
  batch 6).** Only some Repeal bills carry the "deals with climate crisis"
  tag (`pop` POST 552); players gamed this — bills that should affect
  Planet Health but aren't tagged slip through scoring. **Per-bill
  meter-impact tags must be complete and verified at dataset-build time**;
  generalizes to other meter-impact tags. Folds into the **existing
  dataset-regeneration scripts** at `scripts/legislatorsToDataset.mjs` (or
  a sibling validator) — a CI/dataset-time validator at the existing
  pipeline. Not a standalone build item. → **dataset pipeline (§7)**.
- (DH-3 / DH-5 / #85 were cheap enough to promote to quick-wins QW5/QW6/QW7;
  DH-24 / DH-27 promoted to QW8/QW9 batch 6; **DH-30 promoted to QW10 batch 7**.
  DH-31 → E2 [bill-typing]; DH-32 → E25 [SCOTUS docket]; DH-35 → E11/E13/E24
  [era-gate the action libraries]; DH-33 → author-before-build [E29]; DH-34 →
  roadmap-decision [ship static].)

### Deferred / parking lot

- **Multiplayer — hot-seat (M1).** Round-robin the existing `needsPlayerInput`
  mechanism (`engine.ts:9`) across human factions before `advancePhase`.
  **Hard-blocked on K0 (determinism) AND on K2 + all six action libraries AND
  on K5 + the CPU handler suite** — the player-input modalities *are* the
  action libraries, and any CPU faction in the rotation uses the K5 handlers.
  **`drums` (all-CPU) confirms solo + multiplayer are two modes of one
  engine**: the K5 handlers serve both cases identically — a human taking over
  a CPU faction mid-campaign just disables the handler for that faction
  (§9.5). Also needs the singleton refactor: `playerFactionId` →
  `playerFactionIds: string[]` + audit every "is this me?" call site (debt
  #10). — gap #1, §9.5.
- **Multiplayer — async / backend (M2, L–XL epic).** IndexedDB is per-browser
  (`db.ts`); shared state needs a server (or CRDT/host-authoritative sync).
  Hard-blocked on K0 + M1. Exposes debt #6 (whole-snapshot clone+save
  bottleneck). — gap #1, §9.5.
- **Politician-to-politician trading (DH-37, NEW batch 8 — the #1 AMPU-2
  wishlist item).** A trade window between factions to swap politicians. A
  genuine small feature, but **not on any critical path** — it pairs with the
  era-boundary faction-trade window (mechanics §27.2 step 1, which DOES exist in
  spec) and with multiplayer. Park it. — DH-37 (`new1772`).
- **All-human Convention deadlock handling (DH-39, NEW batch 8 — multiplayer
  convention machinery).** With every faction human-controlled, the Convention
  can deadlock with no CPU compromise/dark-horse path to break it (`new1772`).
  The CPU side of convention deadlock is owned by E9 handler 9e (auto-drop-out +
  dark-horse, DH-8/DH-17); the **all-human** case needs an explicit
  deadlock-resolution rule that only matters once multiplayer (M1) lands — so it
  rides the convention epic (E10) + multiplayer. Park until M1. — DH-39
  (`new1772`).
- **Bill-scoring Phase B (divergence #1).** Re-tune `cardVoteBias`
  (`phaseRunners.ts:1516`) per-card-aware once the E20 leaderboard is live
  and playtested. — divergence #1.
- **Conversion-targeting refactor (divergence #3).** **Keep shipped for
  now.** Revisit after E19 emits a rule-driven `Can Party Flip` signal
  cleanly. (Listed as Phase-1 #21 in §9.6 "if pursued"; bundle DH-5's
  pairing-dissolution here if QW6 is deferred.) **`drums` #76 supplies the
  full 2-layer Disgruntled-auto-flip + active-poach %-table + adjacency
  gating + failure-strip — which becomes the K5 handler 9f spec when the
  refactor is approached.** — divergence #3, debt #13.
- **Named-ordinal meter relabel (presentation half).** The full labeled-
  ordinal meter *presentation* (vs the ±3 clamp in QW3 + crisis/cascade in
  E6) touches every meter read/write + the UI; ride it on the presentation
  track only if playtest says the numbers read poorly. The first-class
  war-score meter rides E3. — §21.8/§22.1.
- **Far-future / progressive era (post-1892, pre-modern).** Feminists /
  socialists / communists / prohibitionists / eugenicists / labor activists;
  movement/coalition spawning across eras (#6). The `progressive` enum
  value is added in K4; a `progressive` scenario lifts in once a
  progressive digest lands. **★ This is the FURTHEST the corpus documents — there
  is NO "Era of the Future" beyond it (batch-8 NEGATIVE RESULT).** No ingested
  thread reaches a post-Gilded/post-modern era (`tea1772`, titled "…to future,"
  stalls at 1874 mid-Gilded), so a future era has **no source and no build
  target**; **do NOT scope one**. K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`. — gap
  #2, #6; batch-8 negative result (`tea1772`).
- **Gilded-Age issue *system* depth.** Per-issue interest groups, full
  era-event spines, imperialism annexation flow distinct from `admitState`
  — beyond the E22 data shells. — gap #3, #6.
- **Cabinet "free pick-up" legislation (12b) + foreign-volunteer scheduling
  (#46).** The 1772 Treasurer free-pickup variant; events scheduling a
  future-draftable figure (Lafayette 1784) routed to the lowest-scoring
  eligible faction. (The general Executive-Branch-Interference form is E29;
  Free Executive proposals from SecTreas/SecWar are wired into E14's bill
  pipeline.) — gap #12b, #46.

---

## Sequencing notes

Why the order is what it is — the tech-lead's binding calls (§9 batch-11 lead + §9
batch-10 lead + §9.1.9 + §9 batch-9 lead + §9.1.5 + §9.1.8 + §9.1.3 + §9.6 + §9.1.6 +
§9.1.7 + §6.6.1). **Batch 11 is LATE-GAME PLACEMENTS + one fork-resolution, NOT a
re-sequence** — the batch-11 leads come first (below), then the batch-10 leads, then
the batch-9 leads, then the batch-8 confidence leads, then the three batch-7 leads,
then the carried batch-5 leads. **The order itself is UNCHANGED — the top of the queue
is QW0 → K0/K2 → K3/K4 + the `scenarioBoot`/`BootSheet` pipeline → `scenario1788`
(E1) …**

**★ Batch-11 lead A — #116 economic engine = a NEW small epic `E4c`, placed AFTER
E2 + E6 + E4b(b); build it EMERGENT, not scripted** (tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead #1 —
BINDING):
> "#116 is the long-run content STATE MACHINE sitting on top of E4b(b)'s §27.6
> Second-Bank institution. It needs E2 (`Bill.type` / crisis bypass), E6 (named EconStab
> meter + crisis/cascade), and E4b(b) (the Bank it recharters/replaces). Build it
> EMERGENT — recurring CRISIS bills that resolve an EconStab CRISIS → Independent
> Treasury via a `Bill.replaces` field + a per-bill-class `lockedUntilYear` tariff
> cooldown — NOT scripted. Carry 'scripted-vs-emergent' as a design note, not a blocker.
> Verified UNBUILT: `applyEffect` (`phaseRunners.ts:3209`) only nudges 7 meters;
> `Legislation` (`types.ts:1506`) has no `type`/`replaces`/`lockedUntilYear`."

So **E4c sequences after E2 + E6 + E4b(b)** and is a SMALL epic (three additive fields
on a substrate that already exists). It is **content** sitting on the §27.6 Bank
institution — it does not move any keystone or re-order the spine.

**★ Batch-11 lead B — #119 RE-SCOPES E5, #61 RE-SCOPES E10b (do NOT open new epics)**
(tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead #2/#3 — BINDING):
> "#119 amendment lifecycle → ADD to E5: the explicit lifecycle (propose→committee→
> floor→governor-ratify→active), the active-amendment-blocks-a-legislation-class hook
> (the proactive face of E5's existing *Pollock* gate), and the un-bundleable flag (no
> `amendments` field in `GameState` today). #61 succession chain → ADD to E10b:
> VP-succeeds-on-death → fill-VP (gated on E5's VP-vacancy amendment being `active`) →
> acting-president action-divert roll + trait side-effect. The KILL TRIGGER already
> SHIPS (`anytimeEvents.ts:232` fires `{kind:'death'}`; death sets `presidentId=null`
> via `vacateOffice` `phaseRunners.ts:2449`) — so the succession ENGINE is the work; the
> line-of-succession/impeachment half stays parking-lot (DH-54)."

So **E5 + E10b are STRENGTHENED in place** — both sit in their existing Phase order
(E5 mid-Phase-1, E10b after E10). #61's VP-succeeds/acting-divert path is ready-to-build;
its line-of-succession half is the already-listed DH-54 author-before-build item.

**★ Batch-11 lead C — #51 PROMOTED (now SETTLED); only #18 + the NEW delegate-class
fork stay Decision-gated** (tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead #4/#5 — BINDING):
> "The 4-step enthusiasm-reshuffle + −100/waiver rule → E23, now `ready` (the `arkzag`

So **E23 is now `ready`** (the reshuffle is no longer fork-blocked), **QW3's ±3 cap is
un-gated** (ships with E6), and **Decision-gated holds at 2** (#52 SCOTUS + the merged
#18-state-scope/delegate-class election-engine picks).

**★ Batch-11 lead D — the bug-folds + the meta-signal** (tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead
#6/#8 — BINDING):
> "DH-59 (XS) folds into E12 when the 9-point relations scale is built — no standalone
> patch (today it clamps −5..5 at `applyEffect:3223`). DH-60 (S) = the concrete face of

> deaths + 1 survived-by-scripting) that STRENGTHENS the automation-reduces-upkeep
> argument behind E9/#55/#115. Cite it; don't queue a row."

So **DH-59 → E12, DH-60 → E15+BUG-1** (no standalone rows), and the **3-thread
automation signal** is folded into the upkeep-reduction rationale (DH-36, below) rather
than queued. **#115 priority is UNCHANGED** (re-confirmed by the continuation-boot, §9.1.9)
and **no keystone moves.**

**★ Batch-10 lead A — the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` PIPELINE (#115) is PROMOTED to
the FRONT of the subsystem queue, but it FOLDS INTO K4's `BootSheet` schema — it is
NOT a new keystone** (tech-lead §9.1.9, §9 batch-10 lead #1 — BINDING):
> "#115 is the single most-requested missing item in the forum's own words — there
> are no documented rules for CREATING a game. Verified shipped-state: NO shared boot
> abstraction — `startNewGame` (`GameContext.tsx:264`) switches on a literal into
> hand-authored `build1772Scenario`/`build1856Scenario`; `scenario1856.ts:44-214`
> seats Congress with raw `Math.random`, naive Senate-class assign, full `EV-2` House

> scenario becomes a data row. This is the venue for the XS boot validators (DH-24,
> DH-27) and the appointment-ladder."

So **#115 sequences K0 → `scenarioBoot`/`BootSheet` (built with K4) → scenarios-as-
data**, and is **built with `scenario1788` (E1) before the third hand-authored copy.**
It is NOT a keystone (it folds into K4); QW8/QW9 + the #115b appointment-ladder live
inside it. No new keystone, no re-order — but the boot pipeline moves to the front of
the subsystem work because the next scenario (E1) needs it and would otherwise be a
third hand-authored copy.

**★ Batch-10 lead B — TWO forks are DECISION-GATED (a HUMAN design pick), NOT
ready-to-build** (tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #2 — BINDING):
> "Each fork has 3 live models and needs a human design pick first. Player-controlled
> SCOTUS (#52): all-CPU-by-ideology vs player-controllable-with-restrictions vs
> trait-gated — but the SCOTUS docket data structure is needed either way (→ E25); it
> lives in `src/data/scotusCases<Era>.ts` + a `GameState.scotusDocket` ledger (shipped
> court is a coin-flip, `phaseRunners.ts:3397,3648`). Meter→enthusiasm→election
> (#18/#51): 'every state unless penalized' vs 'ideology-leaning states only' vs
> 'primaries only.' Settled part: meters move enthusiasm boxes + a hard ±3 cap. Shipped
> `calcStateVote` (`phaseRunners.ts:3685`, score `:3709-3711`) applies enthusiasm
> uniformly with NO ±3 cap, NO per-state penalty — the cap is a queued XS clamp (QW3)
> but its binding point + state-scope wait on this fork."

So both forks are recorded under **"Decision-gated"** in the parking lot — NOT in
"Up next." **The work that does NOT wait on the picks is buildable now:** the SCOTUS
**docket** (E25, the player-vs-CPU surface is what's gated) and the **meter-write ±3
clamp** (QW3, the enthusiasm-application binding is what's gated).

**★ Batch-10 lead C — the SIZED corroborated fixes slot into existing epics**
(tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #3 — BINDING): **DH-53** bill-EV-sign = **S, author
STRUCTURED bill-effect tables** (NOT a sign-flip — `Legislation.effects` has no
per-state EV field; `applyEffect` `phaseRunners.ts:3209` can't mutate `electoralVotes`)
→ **E20** + K4's DH-48 `evDelta` shape; **DH-24** Senate-class validator = **XS into
the boot pipeline** (QW8); **focus-Rep (EV−2)/5 House (#55)** = **M into scaling-wall-
(b) (E7) + the census epic (E28)**; **statehood→sectional-crisis (#59)** = **S additive
at `admitState`** (`territories.ts:8` does no balance check; fires from 1820/Nationalism
starts too) → folds into **E3b** (b); **appointment-ladder + replacement-gains timing
(#115b)** = **XS each into boot/appointment rules** (the ladder pairs with **DH-25**).

**★ Batch-10 lead D — the era model is 4-START-CONFIRMED (confidence, not scope)**
(tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #4): `dem1820`'s own draft table prints "Era of Democracy
(1820-1840)" → "Manifest Destiny (1840-1856)" (POST 946), so the #92 content-band model
now holds across **1772 + 1800 + 1820 + 1948**. K3/K4 stay the safest large bet; no
re-spec.

**★ Batch-10 lead E — DH-36 is the PRIORITIZATION ARGUMENT for the upkeep-reducing
items, NOT a row** (tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #5): `dem1820` is the **2nd GA-burnout
DEATH** in the KB (after `new1772`), this one driven by **player friction from
undocumented/inconsistent rules COMPOUNDED by manual upkeep** (a 10-page/8-day midterm;
constant sheet repair). "Automation reduces the manual-upkeep burden that's killing
playtests" is now corroborated across **2 dead threads**, and the friction came from
**undocumented setup rules** — which is exactly the case for **#115 (the boot pipeline
canonicalizes the disclosed ruleset), #55 (focus-Rep cuts House upkeep), E7 (House-
slate persistence), and K5/E9 (the CPU suite owns the deterministic upkeep a human GM
can't sustain).** It justifies the ORDERING (boot pipeline + upkeep-reducers near the
front), not a new item.

**★ Batch-9 lead A — the era model is 3-START-CONFIRMED and gains a TWO-LEVEL
refinement + a structured-era-event-data requirement; still NOT a new keystone, NO
re-sequence** (tech-lead §9.1.5 updated, §9 batch-9 lead #1 — BINDING):
> "Two saves at two start years (batch 8) + a third start year (1948, batch 9), one
> deterministic band sequence ⇒ the era keystones (K3/K4) are the safest large bet
> in the roadmap… Both must be built; do NOT collapse them: (a) point-banked
> Historical Eras with RULE-DELTAS (the Era-of-Terror cabinet rework proves bands
> carry rule changes, not just content) AND (b) a separate per-decade census doing
> bulk EV-reallocation + state-bias re-lean + content-rotation… era-event data needs
> STRUCTURED `evDelta`/census fields (DH-48 — the Neocon census events were LOST as
> free-text). 'Neocons' is a faction-rebrand, NOT a band."

So K3 gains the census-as-a-second-schedule + the per-band rule-delta hooks; K4 gains
the structured era-event data + per-era completeness validators. Both stay **M**;
both land inside the existing keystones. No new keystone, no re-order.

**★★ Batch-9 lead B — NEGATIVE SCOPE: there is NO Cold-War subsystem; do NOT queue
one** (tech-lead §9.1.8, the single most important scope-control finding this batch
— BINDING):
> "Despite the 'Nuclear Age' title there is NO purpose-built Cold-War system — no
> containment engine, no nuclear/MAD model, no NATO/Article-5 bloc, no space-race
> subsystem, no army/navy/air branches… Grep confirms only `revolutionaryWar.ts`
> exists… Net: zero new engine subsystems for 'the Cold War.' The work is the generic
> war engine + diplomacy (both already on the roadmap) + content."

So the Nuclear-Age era is **DATA on top of E3 (generic war) + E12 (diplomacy)** — and
those two rows gain the load-bearing build-holes the label hides: **E3 must RESOLVE**
(DH-47: wars never end today; ideally army/navy/air branches), and **E12 is the real
modern foreign subsystem** (8 relation meters + ambassador actions; DH-46 downward
pressure; DH-45 USSR-collapse trigger). This mirrors the batch-8 no-future-era guard:
a negative result that prevents the biggest scope-creep risk in the modern era.

**★ Batch-9 lead C — CPU-faction AI is LOAD-BEARING (K5 + E9 elevated, NOT
re-sequenced)** (tech-lead §9.1.3 priority bump — BINDING):
> "The digital APP is built for 1-human-vs-9-CPU (multiplayer 'goes off the rails';
> the points system is for the CPUs, not humans)… the app is a solo adaptation of a
> multiplayer game, so the entire multiplayer apparatus must be CPU-AI-driven… This
> does NOT re-sequence K5 (it still lands after K0 + K2), but it raises K5 + the
> handler suite (E9) from 'force-multiplier' to the load-bearing system that makes
> the product playable solo at all."

So K5's **placement is unchanged** (after K0+K2, parallel with K3/K4); its
**priority/status rises** — the E9 handler suite is now a first-class Phase-1 system,
not a nice-to-have. The `nuke` thread also confirms the whole MP-apparatus surface was
**entirely UNEXERCISED** by the human playtest, so it must be authored from spec.

**Batch-9 small placements (no re-order):** E16 → **create-AND-abolish** cabinet
seats (`abolishesCabinetSeat?`); E25 → **legislated variable SCOTUS size +
excess-not-replaced** (#112); E10b/E29 → the modern institutional layer (#105 +
DH-54 author-before-build); E20 → realignment + landslide-cap (#108/#110/DH-52); E30
→ `scenario1948` as a 4th `BootSheet` boot + DH-51 dataset parity. **Senate
pass-threshold resolved-in-code = simple majority** (`phaseRunners.ts:3562`); the
60%/cloture design question stays OPEN for the human. **Parking lot → 12** (DH-49
population-model+House-cap, the one new infra item; DH-54 impeachment/succession).


**★ Batch-8 lead — the ERA MODEL (K3/K4) is now the HIGHEST-confidence finding in
the KB; this batch changes confidence, not structure** (tech-lead §9 batch-8 lead
/ §9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump — NO re-sequence, NO new keystone):
> "Two independent saves emit the identical era-band sequence at identical in-game
> dates: `tea1772` (1772-start solo all-CPU) and `rep1800` (1800-start
> multiplayer), 28 in-game years apart. The bands are deterministic game-state
> content-gates, not GM flavor. **The K3/K4 spec was already condition-driven from
> batch 7 — nothing changes structurally.** This raises the era keystones to the
> **highest-confidence large bet in the roadmap**; treat the content-band model as
> settled."

So: (1) **K3/K4 are MULTI-SAVE PROVEN** — the safest large era bet; start there if
engine staffing is scarce. (2) **#102's dual era-scoring** (per-era + cumulative)
is the **WIN-CONDITION scoreboard** — it folds into K3/K4 point-banking (the win
condition is DUAL), not a new item. (3) **E16's dynamic-seat refactor is
reinforced** — `cabinetSeatsForYear` is the WRONG model at BOTH ends
(founding offices-by-law + modern bill-creates-a-seat), so it is foundational to
the offices-as-data theme, not modern-only. (4) **DH-41 is the one new
author-before-build item** (the general SCOTUS-ruling → statute cascade, deferred;
parking lot → 10 total). (5) **★ NEGATIVE RESULT — no thread reaches a "future"
era; the roadmap does NOT scope one (K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`).**
(6) **DH-36 (GM-burnout abandoned a 12-turn game) is the META justification** for
the whole build — cited in the intro, not queued. All other batch-8 deltas
(#100/#103/#104/#105 + DH-38/39/40/42/43/44) **fold into existing epics** with no
re-order; **DH-43 lands as QW11** (Vermont dataset fix).


**★ Batch-7 lead A — the ERA-MODEL REFRAME re-specs K3 + K4, it is NOT a new
keystone** (tech-lead §9.1.5 / §9.6 lead #0 / divergence #18 — the single most
important call this batch, and the biggest architectural reframe of the era
keystones across all 7 batches):
> "An 'era' in AMPU is a **content-band** — a set of available bills + era-events
> + draftees + a state-bias table — that the game advances through on **game-state
> / meter / territory-ownership triggers, evaluated per half-term**, NOT by
> matching a real calendar date… Verified: phases gate by `year % 4`/`year % 2`
> (`phases.ts:49-59`, **correct for cadence and stay**); the ONLY era advance is
> the hard-coded `currentEra = 'federalism'` at `constitutionalConvention.ts:198`;
> **there is no year→era derivation anywhere** — so this is a generalization of
> one existing trigger, not a rewrite. `advanceEra(snap)` watches an
> `era.advanceWhen` condition; content gates on `game.eraBand` + a new
> `territoryOwned` predicate, **not the calendar**. RECONCILES #68 per-era
> point-banking + §26 BootSheet boot model + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE
> era system."

So K3 changes from `advanceEra(snap, target)` to `advanceEra(snap)`; K4 gains the
per-era content-band registry `{bills, eraEvents, draftees, biasTable,
advanceWhen}`; the early sub-bands (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) are
content-band **markers**, not new enum values (tech-lead's call: markers first).
Both stay **M**. The new `territoryOwned` predicate is **one predicate, three
consumers** (bills, era-events, draft pool).

**★★ Batch-7 lead B — the RECONSTRUCTION SOLO-BLOCKER (DH-29) is a hard BUILD
REQUIREMENT on E3b** (tech-lead §9.1.6 / §9.6 lead #1 — the second-most-important
call, a hard gate on the 1856-arc shipping as a winnable solo game):
> "GM-verified (`rep1800` POST 9170): the historical Strict/Ironclad readmission
> plan can **NEVER pass with CPU factions** → **solo Reconstruction is
> UNRESOLVABLE**, which dead-ends the 1856-arc as a winnable solo scenario (and
> AMPU is single-player). **E3b's definition-of-done must include a CPU-passable
> readmission path** — my rec: (1) a CPU default-vote bias for the flagged
> historical plan (K5 handler #2) **+** (3) an era-boundary auto-resolution
> backstop (K3). The readmission half of E3b should land AFTER K5 handler #2 or
> carry the era-boundary auto-resolution as its self-contained fallback. **Ties
> E3b to the CPU handler suite (K5 / E9).**"

So E3b's readmission half (sub-PR d) is **gated on E9 handler #2 OR K3's
condition-driven `advanceEra`** — the one place the 1856-arc genuinely *needs* the
CPU handler suite, not merely benefits from it. The war half (a–c) is unblocked.

**★ Batch-7 lead C — IDEOLOGY-AS-CIRCLE is FOUNDATIONAL — a central-helper
refactor behind an era-gated flag; place it EARLY-ish (Phase-1 #5b / E5b)**
(tech-lead §9.1.7 / §9.6 lead #2 / divergence #19):
> "`IDEOLOGY_ORDER` (`types.ts:14`) is **LINEAR** and ideology distance is
> **open-coded at 10+ engine call sites** (`factionCenter` `phaseRunners.ts:715`,
> `stepToward` `:740`, conversion adjacency `:993-1003`, sponsor `:3548`, a
> private `firstContinentalCongress.ts:120` helper, + 3 UI pages) — **there is NO
> central distance helper today**. Add `ideologyDistance(a, b, circular)`, migrate
> the 10+ sites (behavior-preserving while `circular = false`), gate the wrap on
> `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?`. Steps 1-2 are **cheap and additive while the
> flag is off**, and they pay down a latent consistency risk — every later
> ideology consumer (the SCOTUS within-1-step auto-AYE §26.6, the conversion
> handler #6, the faction-center math) gets the single helper for free. **Not a
> keystone** (nothing blocks on it), but the cheapest while early and the most
> error-prone if deferred."

So E5b lands the helper + migration **before** E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n)
handlers, so they call it from day one rather than open-coding distance an
11th/12th time.

---

Carried batch-5 leads (still binding):

1. **K5 (`CpuController` scaffold) is a NEW late-keystone — after K0 + K2,
   parallel with K3/K4 + federalism** (tech-lead §9.6 call #1, §9.1.3 — the
   single most important batch-5 call):
   > "The shipped engine has **no agent-decision pass at all** (3 thin stubs
   > only). The §25 spec'd 15 subsystems have nowhere to live without it. K5
   > itself is ~120 lines (orchestrator + handler interface + tie-breaks + 2
   > `repair()` backfills + 1 determinism test). It **unlocks ~15 follow-on
   > handler PRs** that parallelize across contributors. K5 is a
   > force-multiplier, not a scenario gate — federalism + the 1856-arc epic
   > can ship with stubbed handlers and upgrade together."

   So K5 sits as the 6th Phase-0 keystone, parallel with K3/K4. The 15-handler
   suite is a single Phase-1 epic (E9) ordered by §6.6.1's handler-order table.

2. **Cabinet-confirmation system (DH-23) is XS-S, NOT M — because the broken
   system isn't built yet** (tech-lead §9.6 call #2, §9.3 #14):
   > "`runPhase_2_3_1_Cabinet` (`phaseRunners.ts:2158-2223`) is a one-step
   > scored pick with no Senate vote. So the fix is 'build the confirmation
   > step in the right shape from day one' (default-AYE baseline + Iron-Fist
   > Maj-Leader auto-AYE-own-picks + lobby-maximizer Admin-weighting), which
   > is CPU handler #4 (§6.6.1). Lands as a sibling of the cabinet-retention
   > refactor (Phase-1 #16)."

   So DH-23 is **not a quick-win**; it lands at E16 as the XS-S confirmation
   step + at E9 handler 9d for the CPU side.

3. **What's READY now vs. what still needs design** (tech-lead §9.6 call #3):
   > "**READY (no design task remaining):** the 13 §25 subsections #25.1–#25.8
   > + #25.10–#25.14 — all 15 CPU handlers can be authored against §25
   > verbatim. Plus #79 25/10/5 Justice drift, #80 ±3 swing cap, #82 veto
   > override 2/3, #83 midterm meter+enthusiasm, #85 5%/half-term
   > retire-death. **NEEDS DESIGN (parking lot):** divergence #10 / #84
   > contingent-election rules (5 rulesets invented mid-thread, no canonical
   > answer); §25.9 Iron-Fist split (the 6 child traits' exact names + cascade
   > rules); DH-1 filibustered-MUST-pass; DH-12 white-peace; DH-13
   > faithless-elector trigger; DH-14 era-aware bill impacts; DH-15
   > small-state multiplier."

   READY-now count went from ~30 to ~45+ this batch; needs-design grew from
   1 (DH-1) to 7 (DH-1 + #10/#84 + §25.9 + DH-12/13/14/15).

4. **BUG-0 is the cheapest win in the whole roadmap — do it first** (carried
   from batch 4):
   > "Verified: `RELOCATION_ATTEMPTS_PER_TURN = 5` at `types.ts:247`; one-line
   > const edit, no migration, no dependency."

   Sits at the very top of the quick-wins (QW0).

5. **Per-era point BANKING (#68) reshapes the era keystones + the win
   condition — not a new item** (carried from batch 4):
   > "The era boundary is a bank-and-zero + award + full 2.1.x→2.3.1 re-run +
   > content-swap pipeline; the per-era banks sum toward the (open) cross-era
   > win total. Build `advanceEra` with the bank step from the start."

6. **The Civil-War / Reconstruction epic lands EARLY-ish (E3b) because it
   COMPLETES a shipped scenario** (carried from batch 4):
   > "`scenario1856.ts` ships today but its era-event spine dead-ends at the
   > Trent Affair (1861); adding #56/#57/#58/#59 completes a half-finished
   > playable scenario."

   E3b sits right after generic war (E3) + K2, **not** behind federalism (E1)
   or the modern tail. **Batch 5 adds: it is the first scenario to get a full
   K5 handler suite — wire handlers as they land.**

7. **Generic war (E3) is DESIGNED multi-theater + tiered from day one — with
   the multi-confirmed formula** (tech-lead §9.6, sharpened batch 5):
   > "`drums` re-derives the formula `Win% = Difficulty + Planning + Officer×10
   > + MilPrep + Benchmarks` end-to-end across Eastern + Western + Utah + WWI
   > + Mexico + Sioux — the single most multiply-confirmed cross-era resolver
   > in the knowledge base. `WS ≥ +11` auto-win; war-end `WS×2 = %`; post-war
   > defeat `|WS|×2×10`; naval-N-then-ground per-war; Treaty A-D + 3-roll
   > chain. The Civil War is the Major-tier instance — a configured instance,
   > not a rewrite."

8. **K2 (ActionRegistry) remains the second-most-important keystone after K0**
   (~6× leverage across 6 action libraries) **AND is a hard prerequisite for
   K5** — most CPU handlers pick from a registry library. Do K2 first if only
   one keystone lands this quarter.

9. **The two-track parallelization is still the biggest schedule lever**
   (tech-lead §9.4, §9.6). Sync points: a handful of additive `Politician`/
   `Party` fields + two deeper handoffs (A4 ↔ E3 war odds; P2 ↔ E8 portraits).
   Start the presentation track immediately with P0.

10. **(carried) #8 cabinet, #7 SCOTUS, the two scaling walls, far-end vs
    near-term.** #8 is a real cabinet wipe→retention refactor (M, E16) —
    batch 2 wrongly said no wipe exists (`:3804-3812`). #7 SCOTUS is
    from-scratch over a *stub* (`:3398-3414`), far-end (E25). The two
    scaling walls (persist House slates E7; procedural pol gen E8) are
    NEAR-term, not modern-only. Federalism before gilded before modern;
    `scenario1788` before a fully-general `advanceEra`.

11. **RNG first (K0).** Determinism is the prerequisite for multiplayer
    AND for **K5's deterministic tie-breaks** (every CPU decision must be
    reproducible from the seed), AND any replay/test harness, a soft gate
    for every roll-heavy subsystem (war E3/E3b, convention E10, governor
    d100s E11, filibuster E14, primary E24), **and a hard gate for the
    seeded procedural pol generator (E8)**.

12. **Within-track dependency notes.** **E18g (numeric `nationalSurplus`/
    `nationalDebt`) is a prerequisite for E2's cap *and* E6's debt field —
    build that sub-item early.** E4's global flip + the 12A toggle need E5
    (amendments). **E4b (early-republic cluster) splits its deps: (a)
    slavery-flag+Cohens needs E25's SCOTUS docket [the `Cohens` rule-modifier]
    + E5 [the abolition amendment]; (b) Second Bank needs K2 + E13 + the E16
    dynamic seat list; (c) statehood-by-bill needs E21 + K3's `territoryOwned`
    predicate.** **E5b (ideology-as-circle) is independent but lands steps 1-2
    BEFORE E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n) handlers so they call the central
    helper from day one.** E21's statehood needs E2 + E3 + E8 + K3's
    `territoryOwned` predicate; **E3b's Canada arc (#60) needs E21's per-era
    admission gate.** **★★ E3b's Reconstruction readmission half (DH-29) needs
    E9 handler #2 (CPU default-vote bias) OR K3's condition-driven `advanceEra`
    (era-boundary auto-resolution) — its DoD.** E10b's VP-vacancy fill needs
    E5. E14e (investigation) needs E2's bill type. E24 needs E10's CPU delegate
    engine + handler 9i. E26 needs E23. E28 needs E7. **All 15 E9 handlers
    need K5; 9k/9l also need K5's persistent state.** P1/P2/P3 consume P0.

### Estimate caution

Sizes are the tech-lead's. Rows that may still feel XL after a first pass:

- **E3 (generic war)** — sized M–L, but the **batch-9 build-holes may push it
  toward the top of that range**: DH-47 adds a **resolution/peace path** (wars
  never end today) and **army/navy/air branches** to the core formula. Ship the
  base resolver + the resolution path first (it is what makes the Cold-War wars,
  Korea, terminate); the branch model can be a follow-on sub-PR. Remember: this
  is the ONLY war engine — the Cold War relabels it, there is no second engine.
- **E3b (Civil-War / Reconstruction)** — sized L but it is a full subsystem;
  **ship as 5 sub-PRs** (secession #58 → sectional crisis #59 → two-theater
  war #56 + CW variants #97 → Reconstruction #57 → Canada #60), cheap-first.
  **★★ The Reconstruction sub-PR (d) carries the DH-29 solo-blocker DoD** —
  it lands AFTER E9 handler #2 (CPU default-vote bias) or carries K3's
  era-boundary auto-resolution as its self-contained fallback. Do not ship
  the readmission half without a CPU-passable path.
- **E1 (federalism / early-republic epic)** — sized L; expect the era-event
  spine and the SCOTUS set to each be their own sub-PR. The early-republic
  subsystems are folded OUT into E4 + E4b (sequenced after their keystones).
- **E4b (early-republic cluster)** — sized M but **3 independent sub-PRs**
  with different deps (slavery-flag+Cohens → SCOTUS docket + E5; Second Bank
  → K2 + E13 + E16 seat list; statehood-by-bill → E21 + K3's `territoryOwned`);
  ship them as they unblock, not as one epic.
- **E9 (CPU handler suite)** — **~15 PRs**, not one. Order by §6.6.1; ship
  one at a time. Handlers 9k/9l (the DH-* architectural gaps with persistent
  state) land **after** the simpler handlers have exercised the scaffold.
- **E10 (convention)** — the single biggest unbuilt subsystem; **split into
  ~3** (ballot loop → inter-ballot library on K2 → platform/VP/scandal).
  The CPU side is owned by handler 9e (E9), not by this epic.
- **E14 (legislative micro-mechanics)** — now **7 sub-PRs** sharing the bill
  pipeline (block-and-replace → packaging → filibuster → crisis tag →
  investigation #54 → veto override #82 → midterm #83).
- **E16 (cabinet + Congress + offices-by-law + confirmation)** — **four
  coupled jobs** (9-role Congressional pipeline, the cabinet-wipe→retention
  refactor, the XS-S confirmation step DH-23, offices-created-by-law #66);
  **split if any feels XL during scoping.**
- **E30 (modern era scenario)** — the XL capstone; decomposes into roster +
  era-event spine + bill catalog + card pool sub-PRs; gates on most of Phase
  1 + 2.
- **P2 (portrait pipeline)** — an asset-pipeline epic; the no-AI-in-product
  constraint shapes the tech choice from day one; must render generated pols
  (shared with E8).

## Provenance note

This reflects **batches 1–10** — **twelve** ingested digests across **12
playtest threads** (the batch-10 addition is **`dem1820`** — the first 1820-START,
"1820 — The Era of Democracy", 947 posts, GA-burnout-killed at ~1822-23): the
`f4c7c2c4` 1868 Gilded-Age multiplayer dry-run, the
`f55d3e21` 1788 federalism solo-with-AI playtest, the `85f8e6b4` 1772 solo
aesthetic experiment, the `3a9ac985` modern (2004→2020) multiplayer campaign, the
`77db6e6f` **1856-native "A House Divided" Part 2** (9051 posts — the only source
for the Civil-War / Reconstruction / secession machinery), the `e1776bbd`
**all-CPU "Drums of War"** (7540 posts — the first explicit forum record of CPU
heuristics), the `c50d9da7` **"Era of Populism" 2012 fresh-modern boot** (1172
posts — the canonical `BootSheet` + meter-driven endgame), `rep1800` — the **"Era
of Republicanism" 1800→1868 early-republic campaign** (the first procedural record
of the 1800–1856 early republic and the predecessor of batch-1's `gilded`), the
**two batch-8 1772 threads** — **`new1772`** (the **first MULTIPLAYER 1772
founding campaign** — 10 humans 1772→1796, the entire federal apparatus stood up
piece-by-piece from a 1772 start; **abandoned at GM burnout**) + **`tea1772`** (a
157-post **solo all-CPU 1772→1874 fast-traversal** that stalls mid-Gilded) — and
now the **batch-9 `nuke`** thread: the **Nuclear-Age / Cold-War / modern-half
campaign** (1948→Era-of-Terror ~2005; at **12,228 posts the LARGEST corpus in the
KB**, the chronological **predecessor of `modern`**, joined at the 2004 election).
**The KB now spans a CONTINUOUS 1772→2020 timeline:** founding (1772, multiplayer
`new1772` + solo `tea1772`) → early republic (1800→1868, `rep1800`) → Gilded
(1868, `gilded`) → Nuclear Age / Cold War (1948→2005, `nuke`) → modern
(2004→2020, `modern` + Populism `pop`), with the antebellum (`hd`) and the all-CPU
war traversal (`drums`) corroborating across the span. **The era-band model is now
4-START-CONFIRMED — 1772 + 1800 + 1820 + 1948.** **This batch-10 pass is PROMOTION +
decision-gating + small placements — NO re-sequence, NO new keystone:**

- **★ PROMOTES the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` pipeline (#115) to the front of the
  subsystem queue, folded into K4's `BootSheet` schema** (NOT a new keystone): there
  are NO documented rules for CREATING a game; build the shared pipeline (K0 → boot
  rolls; `scenarioBoot` + `BootSheet` with K4; scenarios-as-data) WITH `scenario1788`
  (E1), before the third hand-authored copy. Venue for QW8/QW9 + the #115b appointment-
  ladder;
- **★ DECISION-GATES two forks** (new "Decision-gated" category, 2 items): #52
  player-controlled SCOTUS (3 models; docket needed either way → E25) + #18/#51
  meter→enthusiasm→election (3 models; settled ±3 cap → QW3, binding-point → E20/E23);
- **slots the sized fixes:** DH-53 structured bill-effect tables (S → E20 + K4),
  DH-24 Senate-class (XS → QW8/boot pipeline), focus-Rep (EV−2)/5 #55 (M → E7 + E28),
  statehood→sectional-crisis #59 (S → E3b additive at `admitState`), #115b appointment-
  ladder + replacement-gains (XS → boot/appointment rules, pairs with DH-25);
- **makes the #92 era-band model 4-START-CONFIRMED** (K3/K4 confidence bump);
- **records the 2nd GA-burnout DEATH (DH-36) as the prioritization ARGUMENT** for the
  upkeep-reducing items (#115, #55, E7, K5/E9) — NOT a row; author-before-build count
  stays **12**.

And the batch-9 pass that this one leaves UNCHANGED in order — **CONFIDENCE +
NEGATIVE-SCOPE + small placements, NO re-sequence, NO new keystone:**

- **★ K3/K4 (the era model) is now 3-START-CONFIRMED** (1772 + 1800 + **1948**)
  and gains a **TWO-LEVEL refinement** (point-banked Historical Eras carrying
  rule-deltas + a separate per-decade census doing EV-realloc + bias-re-lean +
  content-rotation; do NOT collapse them) **+ a STRUCTURED-era-event-data
  requirement** (DH-48, typed `evDelta`/census fields + per-era validation); the
  "Neocons" mislabel is logged as a faction-rebrand, NOT a band;
- **★★ records the NEGATIVE-SCOPE Cold-War guard** — there is NO Cold-War
  subsystem to build (only `revolutionaryWar.ts` exists); the Cold War = the
  generic war engine (E3) + the diplomacy subsystem (E12) + content (data), and
  those two rows gain the real build-holes (E3 must RESOLVE — DH-47; E12 needs
  downward pressure + the USSR-collapse fix — DH-45/46);
- **★ elevates K5 + the E9 handler suite to a first-class LOAD-BEARING Phase-1
  system** (the APP is 1-human-vs-9-CPU, #114; K5's placement is unchanged);
- **strengthens E16** (create-AND-abolish cabinet seats), **E25** (legislated
  variable SCOTUS size), and folds the modern election/institutional layer + the
  `scenario1948` 4th-boot + DH-45..DH-58 into existing epics;
- **records the Senate threshold as resolved-in-code (simple majority) / the
  60%-cloture question as an OPEN human decision**;
- **adds DH-49 (population model + House cap — the one new infra item) + DH-54
  (impeachment/succession ruleset) to the parking lot → 12.**

And the batch-8 confidence-hardening pass that this one leaves UNCHANGED in order:

- **★ bumps K3/K4 (the era model) to HIGHEST confidence — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN**
  (§9.1.5 batch-8 bump): `tea1772` (1772-start) + `rep1800` (1800-start, 28 in-game
  years apart) emit the identical era-band sequence at identical dates (#102), so
  the content-band model is settled. No structural change; **#102's dual
  era-scoring (per-era + cumulative) is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard**, folded into
  K3/K4 point-banking (#68);
- **★ strengthens E16's dynamic-seat refactor justification** —
  `cabinetSeatsForYear` confirmed the WRONG model at BOTH ends (founding
  offices-by-law `new1772` §24.6 + modern bill-creates-a-seat `pop`), no new work;
- **★ adds DH-41 to the author-before-build parking lot (now 10 total)** — the
  general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade, UNBUILT and `vcczar`-deferred;
- **folds the new small mechanics into existing epics:** #100 (SCOTUS-overturns-
  amendment + amendable-threshold) → E5 + E25; #103 (pres-vote modifier stack +
  era-issue list) + DH-42 (meter-vs-lean balance) → E20; #104 (lone-ideology
  convention exploit) → E9 handler 9e; #105 (stat-collapse → forced resignation) →
  E10b; DH-38 (late-ratification/Rogue-Island window) → E1; DH-40 (justice-count
  not packaged → stall) → E14b + E25 (XS-S); DH-44 (post-12A vote count) → E4;
- **adds QW11** (DH-43 Vermont home-state dataset fix, XS);
- **parks** DH-37 (no pol-trading, #1 AMPU-2 wishlist) + DH-39 (all-human
  Convention deadlock) on the multiplayer track;
- **★ records the NEGATIVE RESULT** — no thread reaches a "future" era, so the
  roadmap does NOT scope one (K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`);
- **cites DH-36** (GM burnout abandoned a 12-turn game) as the META justification
  for the whole build (intro rationale, not a queued row).

The batch-7 re-sequence that this pass leaves UNCHANGED:

- **★ re-specs K3 + K4 for the era-model reframe — NOT a new keystone** (§9.1.5 /
  divergence #18): `advanceEra(snap)` becomes condition-driven (game-state /
  meter / TERRITORY, per half-term — no `target` arg; the CC `:198` line becomes
  the first `advanceWhen` condition); content gates on `game.eraBand` + a new
  `territoryOwned` predicate (one predicate, three consumers), not the calendar;
  the early sub-bands (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) are content-band
  markers; the per-era content-band registry `{bills, eraEvents, draftees,
  biasTable, advanceWhen}` lands at K4. **Reconciles #68 + §26 + §27.1 into one
  era system.** `year % 4`/`year % 2` stay as phase cadence;
- **★★ adds the Reconstruction solo-blocker (DH-29) as a hard DoD requirement on
  E3b** (§9.1.6): the Strict/Ironclad readmission plan can NEVER pass with CPU →
  solo Reconstruction unwinnable; E3b's readmission half must ship a CPU
  default-vote bias (E9 handler #2) AND/OR an era-boundary auto-resolution (K3);
  ties E3b to the CPU handler suite;
- **★ adds ideology-as-circle as Phase-1 #5b (E5b)** (§9.1.7 / divergence #19):
  a central `ideologyDistance(a,b,circular)` helper + migration of the 10+
  open-coded sites, behind a `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?` flag — placed early
  so E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n) handlers call it from day one;
- **folds the early-republic subsystems into E1 + Phase-1 #4/#4b** (E4 12A
  legislature-elector toggle #93; new E4b = slavery-flag+Cohens #94 [SMALLER —
  `State.isSlaveState` already exists] + Second Bank+Bank War #95 +
  statehood-by-bill organize→admit + territory-gate #95);
- **merges era-events-predating-start into BUG-1 (QW1)** — LIVE-confirmed by the
  LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-start episode — and **adds DH-30
  event-scheduler-min-floor as QW10**, BUG-1's companion;
- **places DH-31** (procedure-bill veto-misroute) at E2, **DH-32** (SCOTUS-voids-
  a-state guard + the `Cohens` ruling-bill-class modifier) at E25, **DH-35**
  (era-gate the action libraries) at E11/E13/E24;
- **adds DH-33** (impeachment-rewrite) to author-before-build (E29) and **resolves
  DH-34** as a roadmap DECISION (ship static era-biases — the forum's own stance);
- **notes `scenario1800` (E32)** as an optional later `BootSheet` instance (the
  band is already covered by `scenario1788` + `scenario1856`).

And the batch-8 confidence-hardening pass leaves all of the above **unchanged in
order** — it bumps K3/K4 to HIGHEST confidence (multi-save proven), strengthens
E16's justification, adds DH-41 to the parking lot, folds #100/#103/#104/#105 +
DH-38/39/40/42/43/44 into existing epics, adds QW11 (Vermont), and records the
no-future-era guard + the DH-36 META rationale.

And the **batch-9 pass (this one)** leaves ALL of the above **unchanged in order** —
it makes K3/K4 3-START-CONFIRMED + adds the two-level era refinement + the
structured-era-event-data requirement (all inside K3/K4), records the NEGATIVE-SCOPE
Cold-War guard (the Cold War = E3 + E12 + content), elevates K5 + E9 to load-bearing
(placement unchanged), strengthens E16 (create-AND-abolish) + E25 (legislated court
size), folds the modern election/institutional layer + `scenario1948` + DH-45..DH-58
into existing epics, records the Senate-threshold resolution, and adds DH-49 + DH-54
to the parking lot (→ 12).

**Still provisional.** Subsequent `/ingest-playtest` runs will refine scopes
(especially the CPU handler internals, the contingent-election rules, the
§25.9 split, the convention CPU specifics, the Civil-War sub-splits, the
~16-meter Lingering order, **the war resolution/peace + branch model (DH-47), the
diplomacy downward-pressure tuning (DH-45/46),** and the cross-era win-total number
the per-era banks sum to), may re-split currently L-sized rows, and may surface
items now parked or unknown. **The order above is buildable top-to-bottom today;
re-validate on every digest.** Open design calls that gate ordering
(contingent-election rules, §25.9 Iron-Fist split, DH-12 white-peace, DH-13
faithless-elector cap, DH-14 era-aware bill ideology, DH-15 small-state
multiplier, era-event scheduling hybrid, era-enum split, meter relabel,
procedural-generation distribution, DH-1 filibuster remedy, **DH-33 impeachment
rewrite**, **DH-41 the general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade policy
[batch 8 — author before building it into E25]**, draft 3/3-canonical, Civil-War
end-year, cross-era win total, the batch-7 era-model open Qs (are the early
sub-bands content-band markers or enum values [tech-lead's call: markers first];
the exact scope of the `territoryOwned` content-gate; which Reconstruction
readmission fix E3b ships [CPU bias #1 vs era-boundary auto-resolution #3 vs both
— tech-lead's rec: 1+3]), **and the batch-9 open Qs — the POPULATION-MODEL + House-
cap rule [DH-49, author before the census + Wyoming-Rule]; the impeachment / VP-
vacancy / succession ruleset [DH-54]; the war resolution + branch model [DH-47]; and
the human's Senate-threshold call [simple-majority-in-code vs require 60%/cloture]**)
are tracked in `game-context.md` → Open questions.
