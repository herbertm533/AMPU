## Now shipped (history)

Reverse-chronological. The expertise/abilities/traits/cabinet/lobby epic (PR1–7)
is complete; the knowledge-base infra and eight ingestion batches are knowledge
milestones (no code, but they are what every item below is traced to).

- **Batch-24 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed **TWO founding-era playtests**:
  **`grass1772`** (`5b1b2c33`, a **544-post 2-human-vs-8-CPU 1772** "The Grassroots Divide";
  GM **@Cal**, NOT designer-authoritative — Ted/V posts are; ~1772→1788, **DIED of CPU-
  bookkeeping burnout** ["didn't have the time to run the two player factions and all 8 CPU
  factions," POST 328] then **relaunched by ADDING humans** [8-human + 2-CPU, POST 348]) +
  **`rookie1772`** (`0039e941`, a **1445-post one-player ROOKIE solo run** "We must hang
  together…"; GM **@matthewyoung123**, a self-described rookie, NOT designer-authoritative;
  ~1772→1788/1790 [Washington 1st President], abandoned to GM time-burnout). The **5th + 6th
  captured 1772 sources.** **CORROBORATION-HEAVY** + **ONE genuinely-new founding gap [#176]**
  + a **META-PRIORITIZATION justification raise.** **★ #176 founding MilPrep prerequisite-
  ordering fix** → folds into **E1 (founding/RevWar) + E6 (#67 meter caps)**, S: founding
  MilPrep is hard-capped at ~2 for the whole Era of Independence because the auto-forced 1774
  Continental Army/Navy bills can't move the meter (MilPrep 3-4 gated behind the federalism-era
  Militia Act ~1792) → a permanent founding military crisis (`grass1772#POST 86-90, 121` +
  `rookie1772#POST 26, 32-33`, both INDEPENDENTLY). An AUTHORING CONSTRAINT to honor when
  founding war-content + a meter-prereq ladder are built (shipped has NO tier-prereq system —
  `scenario1772.ts:9-17` boots `military:-2` as a raw scalar), NOT a regression; designer-gated
  open Q. **★★ The marquee is the META-PRIORITIZATION signal:** both runs DIED to the manual
  CPU-faction sim + opaque rules — the single biggest lesson across 24 batches and the **4th
  GM-burnout death** (with `modernday`+`pop2012b`); the **onboarding/solo-app/CPU-AI cluster
  (DH-69 + #114/E9/K5 + the DH-36 note)** now carries the strongest justification in the corpus
  (NO new scope). **★ Minor war constraints** → #155/#56: clamp the doubled-officer Planning
  term to 0-5 (XS) + a scripted-event WIN PATH on the generic `War` model (`grass1772`'s "King
  George grants autonomy"). **★ Corroborations:** #153 command-bootstrap NOW 4-SOURCE (Bartram);
  the founding cluster #86/#133/#67-#134/#100/#101/#92 + #159 ahistorical-Convention from a 5th+6th
  1772 angle. **No new keystone, no re-sequence, batch 24 nets 0; top-of-queue UNCHANGED.**

- **Batch-23 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed **ONE playtest**: **`pop2012b`**
  (`409a7c18`, a **939-post 2012-START modern MULTIPLAYER**; GA-run [**Rodja**] but
  **@MrPotatoTed (game co-author) plays on Blue-5/Obama and his point-of-order corrections
  are DESIGNER-AUTHORITATIVE**). The **SECOND, DISTINCT 2012-start "Era of Populism" run**
  [`pop`/`c50d9da7` is the FIRST] — same seed / 10 named factions / archetype decks, different
  players/outcome (Ron Paul wins the GOP nom and flips OH+FL in a losing general; ran
  2012→the 2014-midterm cycle, did NOT cross an era boundary; **died at GA-burnout — Rodja
  resigned**, POST 932-938). **CORROBORATION-HEAVY** (a 2nd independent 2012-boot re-confirms
  the modern cluster) + **TWO net-new legislation-data gaps in EXISTING epics + one predicate
  sharpening + two clarifications.** **★ #174 committee bill-packaging + ranking-member counter**
  → folds into the committee/bill-packaging epic **E14b (#8/#9/#12, the E14 sub-PRs a/b)**: the
  fullest packaging spec in the KB (`pop2012b#POST 724` verbatim) — a **ranking-member
  un-package/repackage COUNTER** (5 trait gates) + **two chair-add-bill powers** (5 Legis+Efficient
  → off-committee tax; 5 Legis+Magician → one off-topic) + **cross-chamber/cross-committee package
  GUARDS** + the **Puritan committee-voting rule**; STACKS ON the still-unbuilt #8/#9 chair-block/
  package (two pipeline points; chair-side first); needs a ranking-member field on `committeeChairs`
  + `Bill.packageOf?: BillId[]`; binds at `phaseRunners.ts:3463`. **★ Cross-check the 5 gates +
  chair-add powers vs. `tedchange` BEFORE building** (open Q, single-thread source). S–M; verified
  UNBUILT (grep `rankingMember|packageOf|chairBlock` in `src/` = ZERO; runner chair-only at
  `:3463-3496` / `:3476`). **★ #175 law-repealability data model** → small data-model add INSIDE
  **#42 (bill-relationship graph, E29) + §27.5 (statehood-by-bill, E4b)**: MrPotatoTed ruling
  (`#POST 687-688`) — add **`Legislation.repealable: boolean`** + **`lawClass: 'repealable' |
  'replace-only' | 'permanent'`**; gate Repeal on the flag, expose Replace for **tax/immigration**
  (replace-only), mark **statehood** `permanent`; the concrete form of #42's constraints — build
  WITH #42, not standalone. **★ Open Q: authored per-bill list vs. per-row hand-marking** (joins the
  #120 dataset umbrella, E18d). S; verified UNBUILT (`Legislation` `types.ts:1506-1520` has neither
  field; grep `repealable|lawClass` in `src/` = ZERO). **★ #88 PREDICATE SHARPENING (no new item):**
  the apocalypse/coup endgame fires at the meter **FLOOR band, NOT "Crisis"** — `pop2012b` shows
  Planet's Health at "Crisis" with NO clock firing (`#POST 632`), so the predicate is `meter ===
  floorBand`, NOT `meter <= crisisBand`; folds into the existing #88/#158 end-condition + APOCALYPSE-
  clock work at **E6** (debt #28/#32, §9.1.4). **★ #15 VP-rubric + cabinet-decline-CPU-only =
  CLARIFICATIONS (no new build):** the canonical rubric already says "+1 if YOUNGER than 60" (NO "+1
  older than 60"), row 7 reads a discrete **`canBeIndependent` tag** (not office status), and cabinet
  accept/decline %s are **CPU-only** (gate behind `isCPU`; humans free-choose except VP) — all
  covered by **E16 + the convention rubric**; pin the AUTHORITY (MrPotatoTed). **Corroborations:**
  a 2nd 2012-boot re-confirms the modern cluster — **#86** (boot) / **#47/#13** (primary→convention→
  general) / **#15/#16/#18/#51** (VP-rubric / general / 2-layer scorer, "PRE-MIDTERMS STATE OF
  METERS" verbatim) / **#52** (SCOTUS) / **#25/#112/#124** (28-seat cabinet) / **#70** (leadership) /
  **#91** (12A-gated VP) / **#8/#9/#12** (committee) — confidence ↑; **#90/#43** procedural-pol-gen
  LIVE again as career-track starvation in the thin 2013 draft (2nd corroboration, → E8); a **3rd
  GM-burnout DEATH (Rodja)** strengthens the DH-36/DH-69/#114 automation argument (cite, not a row).

  **Decision-gated / parking-lot counts UNCHANGED (batch 23 nets 0 — #174/#175 buildable in existing

- **Batch-22 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed **ONE playtest**: **`modernday`**
  (`65f81fe8`, a **3014-post 2016-START current-rules 8-human modern MULTIPLAYER** — **★ THE
  ONLY modern thread in the KB to CROSS AN ERA BOUNDARY** [the 2024 "Era of Populism"→"Era of
  the Near Future" transition]; GA-run [Rodja→ebrk85] but the marquee rulings are designer-
  blessed in-thread [Ted/vcczar adjudicate]). A **corroboration-heavy** batch + **TWO concrete
  modern build items that sit in EXISTING epics.** **★ #172 era-keyed confirmation thresholds +
  Nuclear-Option** → folds into **E16** (cabinet/confirmation) **+ E14c** (cloture): a
  `GameState.nuclearOption:{cabinet,scotus}` per-start-year boot flag (Cabinet 50%+1 / SCOTUS
  60% for 2016, Ted-authoritative `modernday#POST 422-423`) seeded by `scenarioBoot` + per-track
  threshold reads in the cabinet runner + SCOTUS-nom path + the SML enact/repeal action + the
  60→fail→10-vote-conversion→auto-Mod fallback; **composes with #124/#52/#171 + the batch-9
  cloture decision (do NOT re-litigate)**; S–M (verified UNBUILT — zero cloture/confirmation
  logic in `src/`). **★ #173 era-boundary-aligned starts** → **New-Game start-year PRESETS =
  the 14-band openings** on the scenario-boot picker (#115); each preset = a scenario-as-data-
  row on K4's `BootSheet`; S (verified UNBUILT — `NewGameScreen.tsx` hard-codes 1772/1856 only).
  **★ #68/#2 point-banking → SPEC-ANCHOR CONFIRMED** (the 6-clause banking ritual + score-reset
  + faction-trade window + procedural-content swap fired at a REAL 2024 boundary under current
  rules, `#POST 1871/1874/1902`, matches `rep1800`) — stays folded into K3/K4, NO priority
  change, spec now solid. **★ #171 PROVEN flipping ON (2016-2024)→OFF (at 2024)** in one save
  (`#POST 558/1902`) — sharpens debt #48, no scope change. **★ Two small bugs: DH-70** `Lackey`
  PV over-weight → a `pv.ts` note (when ported, add to `NEGATIVE_TRAITS` for the flat −5, NO
  special-case; shipped `pv.ts:77` already flat-−5's all negatives), XS; **DH-69** no in-app
  rules / legal-move surface → an onboarding/UX item, cite under #115/CPU-AI. **Corroborations:**
  **#43** procedural generator owns the modern→future band (dataset exhausts at the future

- **Batch-21 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed **FOUR playtests**: **`nixon1972`**
  (`4853cf4d`, **417 posts / 4 chunks**, 1972-start modern MULTIPLAYER, GA-run, one half-term
  1972-1974 then GM-burnout stall before Watergate fired); **`cpufull`** (`1f72600c`, **74 posts

  (`51dfaef1`, **87 posts / 2 chunks**, **Ted-run designer-authoritative**, 2024/Jan-2025-start
  modern MULTIPLAYER, **★ SETUP-ONLY**, abandoned before turn 1); **`solo1916`** (`5027f0f3`,
  **38 posts / 1 chunk**, a **1916-start SOLO** Progressive-Era/WWI run, GA-run, ~one half-term
  1916→~1918 then stall). **★★ ONE escalation, FIELD-FALSIFIED: #158 CPU anti-game-over** —
  `cpufull` is the **2nd live CPU game-over** and falsifies the flat-75%-oppose patch (applied,
  yet a game-ending peace passed at a **4-5-4 plurality** after the CC-President's reject was
  overridden) → **re-prioritize HIGHER within the CPU/war track**; the fix is re-scoped to a
  **HARD VETO / points-based anti-peace bias + a NON-plurality-overridable game-ending-peace**;
  it is a **SOLO-PLAY BLOCKER** and makes **#155 RevWar floor #3 LEAKY** (debt #32 escalated +
  #34a). **★ TWO era-keyed gaps (one PARTLY SHIPPED): #170** era-keyed offices (founding-seat
  half LIVE in `cabinetSeatsForYear` `types.ts:1196`; add modern departments + the **DNI⇒CIA-

  anti-game-over fix WITHIN the CPU/war track.** _Complete._
- **Batch-20 ingestion (knowledge milestone).** Absorbed **FOUR meta/design threads** (a
  LIGHT batch — almost no new code): **`planb`** (`094cc3a2`, **146 posts / 3 chunks**, the
  build-FINISHING PROCESS plan, NOT a playtest); **`dbomit`** (`4be5a005`, **106 posts / 2
  chunks**, a missing-pol REQUEST thread → #120); **`biden2021`** (`24061ad6`, **61 posts / 1
  chunk**, a modern era-CONTENT brainstorm); **`ampu2wish`** (`888ba777`, **61 posts / 1
  chunk**, the OUT-OF-SCOPE AMPU-2 wishlist). **★ ONE new runtime mechanic: #169** — the
  "Elderly President Drops Out of Reelection → endorses VP" mid-campaign replacement event
  (the Biden-2024 → Harris analog) → **a SMALL addition to the era-event epic E15 (S);
  DISTINCT from #37** (defeat-then-retire): #169 removes the candidate DURING the campaign, not
  after a loss. **DESIGNED, not built** (zero `dropOut|replaceOnTicket|endorseVP|midCampaign|
  forcedOut|stepAside` hits in `src/`); **the age roll it gates on ALREADY EXISTS** (the
  old-age ability-decay roll `ABILITY_LOSS_RULES.oldAge` `minAge:70` `types.ts:521` +
  `MORTALITY_RULES` + the PV age penalty `pv.ts:85`; the **candidate-relevant roll is keyed at
  70, NOT 75**). The net-new pieces: 50%-to-pull roll → flat **−1 party malus** into the §21.9
  modifier stack (**lands on the VP even when the pres is pulled**) → **VP swapped onto the
  ticket** in `runPhase_2_9_4_PresidentialGeneral` (`phaseRunners.ts:3752`, already takes the
  ticket candidates as params). **Era-of-Populism-scoped until it fires twice.** **★ #168 — a
  PRE-BUILD AUTHORING-QUALITY PASS, NOT a roadmap code epic** (NO code surface): a
  **terminology contract** ("Army"→Military, human-rights→"criminal reform", ideology short
  forms, demographic standardization) + a **branch-path/meter-direction/%-multiplier sanity
  audit** of authored content (the DH-53 effect-SIGN family) + a **trait/interest compilation**.
  **Recorded as an authoring-process gate paired with #120** — the roadmap NOTES it, does NOT
  schedule it as a code task. **★ The CHRONOLOGICAL-IMPORT pipeline constraint** (Anthony
  imports pols/events chronologically; all changes route through vcczar, `planb#POST 37, 72`)
  is recorded as a **PROCESS note that orders the per-era CONTENT authoring** (founding before
  antebellum before modern) — it does NOT reorder the dependency-ordered ENGINE track. **★
  `biden2021` → MODERN ERA-CONTENT** (the 2021-2025 IRA/Infrastructure/SC-reform/Gaza-NATO/
  climate content list extends the modern band past 2020; #92/#41 / E30 / §28.13) — folds into
  the modern content tail, NOT a new epic; the ONE new mechanic is #169; the pardon pres-actions
  BLOCK on #122. **★ `dbomit` → #120** (the ~167-pol catalog + dataset-quality bugs via
  `CURATED_ROWS`/`ERA_FIGURES`, no per-pol rows; standardization rulings pair with #168;
  post-1772 start-game guide → #115). **★★ `ampu2wish` → OUT OF SCOPE — the roadmap schedules
  NO AMPU-2 wishlist item for AMPU 1** (day-by-day Paradox rebuild, full House, dynamic regions/
  biases, scouting/hidden-stats); QUARANTINED only. Two wishes are ALREADY-LOGGED AMPU-2 gaps,
  corroborated not re-logged: **DH-37** (pol-trading, the #1 AMPU-2 wish) + **DH-34** (dynamic
  biases — ship-static stands). `technical-guide.md` §9 updated with the batch-20 LEAD BLOCK +
  §9.6 one-line ordering; `game-mechanics.md` §10.4.7 (#169) + §30.11 (planb process + AMPU-2
  quarantine) added. **Decision-gated / parking-lot counts UNCHANGED (batch 20 nets 0 — no new

  thread ingest and the EARLIEST of the three** (Oct 4 2022 → Sept 21 2023). Started by
  **@vcczar** ("Just post any suggested fixes below… I won't look until Anthony's working
  on the game again") — the **pre-early-release content-build + to-do-clear window**:
  vcczar's OWN additions (tier-1, authoritative) interleaved with cross-playtest balance
  suggestions (tier-4). **It PREDATES + SPAWNS `smallbugs`** (POST 637-640) and **predates
  `tedchange`** (chunks 13-15 = the same systematic 2.2-2.4 rules-doc cleanup Ted later
  formalizes). Corroboration- and provenance-heavy; mostly **#120 dataset work** (~20 named
  items + ~10 bill/event/SCOTUS effect-SIGN bugs + vcczar's own ~1800-legisprop audit) + a
  **scripted-event BUILD-OUT** (~30 events: Shaw/John-Brown demographic-removal + per-state
  abolition/suffrage/segregation/prohibition toggles + demographic-gated draft-ENTRY post-19A)
  that **CORROBORATES the shipped `EraEvent`/`Predicate`/`addPolitician` model, NOT a new gap**
  + the authoritative **late-start event-boot-filter rule** (strip pre-start-era events on a
  later start, POST 413-423). **★ ONE new gap: #167** (the no-eligible-successor presidential
  constitutional-crisis subsystem, POST 841-882) — **FOLDS INTO E10b** as the no-successor
  member of ONE E10b CRISIS FAMILY (verified UNBUILT — zero `successionCrisis|actingPresident|
  coup` hits; `vacateOffice` `phaseRunners.ts:2446` just nulls `presidentId` with NO successor
  path, so #167 and #61 bind on the SAME vacancy site): emergency-Congress succession-law vote
  (auto-signed) → House 1-vote-per-state acting-President election (**reuses the #62 contingent-
  House-election machinery — build #62 once, reuse for both**) → scaled DomStab penalty → coup
  branch (#88/debt #28 end-condition family); **★ ship the PPT-as-acting-President interim
  default FIRST (S), then the full House-election procedure (M); couples #61/#88/DH-54**.
  **★ PROVENANCE = build-CONFIDENCE (no scope): `fixes2022` is the EARLIEST source for
  #153/#135/#124/#121/#88** — designer intent from the START (raise confidence where they sit:
  #153/#88 debt #31/#32; #124 E16; #121 E3b; no resize/move). **★ ENTHUSIASM (#18/#51/#124) =
  the PERENNIAL-FORK RISK FLAG → FREEZE the spec** (the marquee risk flag: Anthony stalled ~½
  into 2.1; vcczar re-derives it differently each playthrough, POST 713-716) — RISK NOTE added
  to **E23 + E20b** that the #51 (drums 4-step) + #18 (terror2000 2-layer scorer) resolutions
  are a FROZEN SPEC, the single likeliest drift point. **★ Era-event FIRING-RATE budget**
  (~70%/era dynamic limit, POST 114-123) → small addition to **E15** (S; runner has none today,
  `phaseRunners.ts:2796`). **★ #120 dataset umbrella → folds the `fixes2022` batch in** (E18d;
  ~20 items + ~10 sign bugs → DH-53 + vcczar's ~1800-prop audit; Bob Scott dup = `smallbugs`
  §2b; one `CURATED_ROWS` pass). **★ Corroborations (tags, not rows):** the scripted-event
  build-out → the `EraEvent` system; the late-start boot-filter → BUG-1/#92; #88/OC-3, #61,
  #56-#60, #119/#39, #92/#72, #115, #38, #160/DH-67/#108, DH-27, DH-36 (the smallbugs genesis).

  ONE Ted-authored ruling this batch, flagged), 8 human + CPU factions, opens at the
  Roaring-Twenties peak (Hoover + Republicans [RED] dominating Al Smith's Democrats
  [BLUE]), runs ~1928→~1936 (Hoover landslide → Great-Depression event fires LATE → FDR
  wins 1932, fades mid-term; the modern BLUE-economic-left is CREATED in play by the New
  Deal). Engine would run on `modern`/`progressive` tuning — UNBUILT. **★ HEADLINE = the
  ECONOMIC ENGINE: the SECOND era to exercise E4c** (after `arkzag`'s 1820s Bank-War /

  Party-Pref −3) + an EconStab cascade (2 random industries −1 nationwide → EV reflow;
  meter-gating in crisis) + crisis-GATED legislation; the GA flags the era's static
  party-modifiers as too strong AND the Depression as too weak (DECOUPLED). The 1932
  Hoover-v-Roosevelt general exercised the #18 2-layer meter→election scorer LIVE; diplomacy
  (#107) corroborated with a 7-nation 1928 roster (no Israel); the "Republicanism vs Fascism
  vs Communism" / WWII framing is FLAVOR, not a war-engine trigger. Gap log gained **#160**

  polarity BLUE = Patriot/anti-Federalist / RED = Federalist). **Deliberately
  CORROBORATIVE** (briefed as a few-NEW-gaps outcome): the **3rd CPU-heavy source** (after

  corroboration confidence** on the founding-boot, the CPU suite, the war engine, and the
  command-bootstrap. Distinct value: the **3rd-source confirmation of Ted's command/
  expertise house rules (#153/#136), applied front-to-back from a 0-Command boot — and
  the cleanest LIVE demonstration in the KB of the command-bootstrap producing an emergent
  President** (1st President Arthur St. Clair, a CPU pol who "started with none of the
  requirements," rose purely through play); the **fullest battle-by-battle RevWar trace =
  the #155 winnability data** (a genuinely-losable RevWar held up by THREE floors:
  French-alliance unloseable-flag + 2/3 peace threshold + Ted's new CPU-anti-game-over
  rule); and the **first solo-game-ender** (a CPU-controlled terminal peace node resolved
  FOR peace by point-math). Marquee value: **★★ #153 PROMOTED to build-with-confidence /

  chunks**), a **Ted-run, CPU-heavy** modern run opening at **Bush's inauguration after

  CPU-heavy source** (corroborates the E9 suite) and the **2nd modern-era native run**
  (after `nuke`'s 1948 start). Distinct value: it produces the **FIRST PROVEN game-over
  / LOSS state in the corpus** — the run ENDS on the **first game-ending event ever in
  any AMPU playtest** (an "Autocratic Coup Ends America" 20%-off-HonestGov-floor roll →

  **6318 posts** — the **LARGEST thread in the KB**), a multiplayer campaign that runs
  **1868 → ~1886** and **dies in GM burnout** (the 3rd GM-burnout death in the corpus,
  after `new1772`/`dem1820`). Distinct value: it is the **richest single record of the
  Gilded-Age issue engine actually being PLAYED** (tariff %, currency regime, civil-
  service, trusts, the 20-yr Reconstruction regime, AfAm enfranchisement, imperialism)
  — but the **Gilded Age is UNBUILT** (`Era` has no `gilded`, `types.ts:1337`; only
  `scenario1772.ts`/`scenario1856.ts`; the era is hand-run on `modern` tuning, gap
  #41), so the thread is **almost entirely the unbuilt design.** Headline value is
  **DOWNSTREAM GILDED-ERA CONTENT, NOT a re-sequence, NO new keystone**: it (1) **adds
  ONE NEW "gilded-era content" epic (EG)** — the five deltas **#147–#150 + DH-63** are
  ONE downstream era unit gated on **K3/K4 + #116/E4c + #42 + #57/E3b** (§9.1.10):
  **#147** tariff-as-%-rate (`game.tariffRate`) + mutually-exclusive `MonetaryRegime`
  enum, replacing the ±0.5 flavor bill at `phaseRunners.ts:3421` (M, on #116/E4c + #42);
  **#149** civil-service merit-vs-spoils axis + State-Gov-Jobs spoils lever + era-gated
  reform content (S–M, on K3/K4); **#150** the "1872 Rule" disorganized-loser special-
  election branch (S, niche; pairs with #57/#148 + #48); **DH-63** currency-regime
  exclusivity **folds into #42 + #147's MonetaryRegime** (XS–S, no standalone row);
  (2) **EXTENDS the #57/E3b Reconstruction epic with #148** — the 20-yr auto-expiring
  Reconstruction timer (`game.reconstruction`, begins 1864, auto-ends ~1884) +
  appoint-seceded-seats-by-Speaker/PPT-faction + a +2-RED bias-while-active → Solid-
  South sunset (FL/GA/LA Blue+3→+5, VA Blue+2→+5) + per-state early end by repeal-bill
  (S–M within E3b, **inherits the DH-29 solo-blocker**); (3) **STRENGTHENS #41** —
  `gild1868` is now the **full native spec** for the dedicated `gilded` era +
  `scenario1868` (red/blue-FLIPPED roster: RED = Republicans / BLUE = Democrats by 1868,
  POST 6; the Gilded nickname table; the era-event spine; the bill catalog; the SCOTUS
  docket; the 20-yr timer) — `scenario1868` is another scenario-as-data-row AFTER

  all-CPU 1788 stress-test** and the **first DELIBERATE CPU-ruleset interrogation**
  (explicitly "to find where the rules are insufficient", POST 1, 5) — the CPU-AI
  validation source for the #70–#78 handler cluster. Distinct value: it is the first
  batch that **systematically validates a whole subsystem's spec (K5 CpuController +
  the E9 §25 handler suite) BEFORE it is built.** Headline value is **E9 DE-RISK, NOT
  a re-sequence**: it (1) **field-validates 6 E9 handlers** — #70 (9c leadership) /
  #72 (9a candidate + 9m VP) / #73 (9d cabinet) / #74 (9b legislation) / #75 (9g
  event) / #76 (9f conversion) go from "designed" to "designed + field-validated with
  concrete failure modes + Ted's fixes" (build-confidence bump, no new rows); **9e
  (convention #71) is the ONE handler NOT validated** (1788 predates conventions →
  stays `drums`-spec-only); (2) **folds the OC-1…OC-8 sub-gaps into the handler rows
  as sub-rules** — **★ OC-3 → 9b** (the ★balance-critical crisis-vote ideology-floor +
  secession check — the peaceful-1792-abolition bug); **OC-2 → 9c** (canonical
  `chamberControl(snap,chamber)` helper); **OC-1 + OC-5 → 9d** (scandal-resignee

  (highest Com+Leg+Gov tiebreak); **#72 sharpen on 9a/9m** (VP-retention HARD rule +
  pre-12A nomination trio); (3) **adds #143 post-election Command decay** (XS, RULED —
  40%/−1 Command for non-Pres/VP candidates per presidential cycle; binds at
  `runPhase_2_10_End` `phaseRunners.ts:4171` gated on `isPresidentialYear`) → **QW17**
  in the XS quick-win cluster; (4) **RE-SCOPES E10b further with the #61 death-branch**
  (S — VP-inherits-on-DEATH = FULL President, no acting/action-divert, NOT auto
  party/faction leader → re-run leadership IRV; "acting"/action-divert retained ONLY
  for the incapacity branch; Ted-RULED `oopscpu#POST 324-329`, SUPERSEDES the
  batch-11 `arkzag` read for the death case); (5) **adds DH-61 (S) + DH-62 (M) as
  explicit `scenario1788`/E1 PREREQUISITES** — DH-61 boot-seed era-active wars (the
  forgotten 1788 NW Indian War → a `BootSheet.activeWars` field + boot hook, folds
  into K4); DH-62 pre-12A two-vote/no-ticket EC mode + same-state-EV (an era-keyed
  election-mode variant → E4); (6) **adds OC-4 + OC-8 to the designer-gated
  sub-bucket** (→ 11 items, was 9): OC-4 off-ideology CPU draft gate (Ted wants "a
  better third way"), OC-8 define "office" + rewrite the Scandalous-Non-Office-Holder
  event (flagged to vcczar) — both OPEN, NOT ready-to-build; (7) **adds the
  ALL-CPU-TEST as a recommended repeatable spec-validation METHODOLOGY** (validated
  6 handlers pre-build, immune to GM-burnout DH-36; recommend a post-12A all-CPU run
  before building #71 / handler 9e — a methodology note, NOT a row); (8)
  **STRENGTHENINGS** (no new rows): #70–#78 field-validated from a founding angle;

  **RE-SCOPES E16 to BUNDLE cabinet confirmation + #124 enthusiasm REWORK from day
  one (sized M, was XS-S)** — Ted's `tedchange#POST 1-4` re-architects the

  enthusiasm via the existing ±3-cap clamp; **lands AFTER K2 + K5** (cabinet picks

### Quick-wins — land immediately (XS each, high feel-value)

Fixes + cheap divergence/balance resolutions. **★★ Batch-12 — BUG-0/QW0 IS NOW
FULLY SETTLED (cap=4 + alt-state EXEMPTION GUARD, vcczar-12-30-25 RULED via
`smallbugs#POST 734-735`) — DO IT FIRST, it's the top of the queue.** **BUG-1 is
the exception that matters:** it is XS but a **hard gate on the federalism epic**
— land it *in or just before* E1. **Batch 7: BUG-1 now ALSO subsumes the
era-events-predating-start-DROPPED hole** (LIVE-confirmed by `rep1800`'s
LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-start episode — a 2nd same-class instance; same bug,
merged). **QW10 (DH-30 event-scheduler-min-floor) is BUG-1's companion** on the
same scheduling surface. DH-2 (modern deck fired off-year cards) is the **same
scheduling surface** as BUG-1 + divergence #4 and is investigated at E15, not as
its own quick-win. **★ Batch-12 adds FIVE new XS quick-wins (QW12–QW16)** — pure
Ted/vcczar one-line/one-helper rulings that bind at known sites with no
dependency: **QW12 #135** 50/50 House inverse-control (one-line at
`phaseRunners.ts:1864`), **QW13 #131** Integrity-can't-nominate-Controversial
filter, **QW14 #132** Challenge-Legislation-can't-target-REPEAL filter, **QW15
#139** Pres signature in 2.6 (phase reorder), **QW16 #141** FL trait gain 5%+/3%-.
Each row is tagged with its `tedchange#POST N` for traceability. **★ Batch-12
absorbs QW11 (DH-43 Vermont) into the #120 dataset umbrella row below** — DH-43
ships as one item in the coordinated `scripts/seedDataset.mjs` pass, not as a
standalone quick-win. **★ Batch-13 adds ONE new XS quick-win (QW17)** — **#143
post-election Command decay** (40% / −1 Command per presidential cycle for any pol
who did NOT run for Pres/VP — "shit or get off the pot"), a Ted-RULED, tested-live
standalone that binds at one known site (`runPhase_2_10_End` `phaseRunners.ts:4171`,
gated on `isPresidentialYear`, after the 2.9.4 ticket roster is known) with no
dependency — it joins the QW0 / XS-consistency cluster. Tagged with its `oopscpu#POST N`.
**★ Batch-15 adds ONE new XS quick-win (QW18)** — **#153 rookie-Command / Command-gain
consistency** (rookies enter at 0 Command + every in-game Command-gain % DOUBLED + no-
reroll-on-held-expertise), now made OFFICIAL by Ted (`terror2000#POST 91-93`). The
0-Command rookie ships already (#136) and no-reroll-on-held-expertise is already an
invariant — **the UNBUILT half is the global ×2 Command-gain multiplier**; pairs with
the #143 Command-decay (QW17) at the same Command-economy surface. Tagged with its
`terror2000#POST N`. **★★ Batch-17 PROMOTES #153 to build-with-confidence / canonical
(no re-size — still XS–S, still QW18, NO new row).** A 3rd source (`ted1772`, the 4th
1772 thread) re-confirms the rule front-to-back from a 0-Command boot, making it
**3-source canonical (`terror2000` · `tedchange` · `ted1772`)**, and — uniquely —
DEMONSTRATES the payoff LIVE: an **emergent 1st President (Arthur St. Clair), a CPU pol
who booted at 0-Command / obscure / no celebrity and rose entirely through play.** The
rookie `command: 0` boot is verified SHIPPED (`phaseRunners.ts:216`); **the only UNBUILT,
LOAD-BEARING piece is the GLOBAL ×2 Command-gain multiplier** — a single `gainCommand(p,
basePct)` helper applying ×2 at the leader-pick / charisma-event / military-victory grant
sites (e.g. the Father-of-the-Constitution `command + 1` at
`constitutionalConvention.ts:158,168` + the RevWar grants in `revolutionaryWar.ts`), plus
the held-tag guard in the expertise-grant path. **It sits on the draft/command path with
NO keystone dependency — ready-to-build now** (this is a confidence raise, NOT a
re-sequence — #153 was a 1-source XS quick-win, now it's 3-source canonical). game-mechanics

| QW0 | **BUG-0 — relocation cap `5`→`4` + alt-state EXEMPTION guard (divergence #9 — ★★ batch-12 FULLY SETTLED, vcczar-12-30-25-RULED)** *(do FIRST — TOP OF THE QUEUE)* | **One-line const edit + a guard at the relocation accumulator.** `RELOCATION_ATTEMPTS_PER_TURN = 4` at `types.ts:247` (shipped value is `5`) **PLUS** a guard so **alt-state moves do NOT count against the 4-total budget** (verify alt-state accounting in `runPhase_2_1_4_Relocations`). **★★ Batch-12: `smallbugs#POST 734-735` (vcczar-12-30-25 "Approved by vczar") SETTLES BOTH halves:** *"A faction is limited to FOUR total attempted moves per half-term. A politician that moves to an ALT-STATE does NOT count against the FOUR total moves."* This **CLOSES** the long-running BUG-0 / QW0 / batch-10 top-of-queue item from "open-design + ready-to-build" to **fully settled and ready-to-ship FIRST**. Settled value, no migration (a tunable const + a guard, not a save field); no dependency. The auto-Carpetbagger + 10-yr-expiry *feature* is QW4 / E17 — this row is the **cap value + the exemption guard**. **The cheapest win in the whole roadmap.** No human review-gate; no designer-gate; the cap value AND the exemption are both authoritative. | — | XS | bug BUG-0 / divergence #9 (`hd` §0/I-1, 7062-7066, 7555) + codebase (`types.ts:247`) + **★★ `smallbugs#POST 734-735` vcczar-12-30-25 APPROVED — cap=4 + alt-state exemption both ruled** — CARRIED + SETTLED | ready (TOP OF QUEUE) |
| QW1 | **BUG-1 — era-event era-lock filter (now ALSO subsumes era-events-predating-start-DROPPED, batch 7)** *(federalism gate)* | Add an era-vs-start-year filter to `buildEraEventsForYear` (`phaseRunners.ts:2817`): an event whose era is past the scenario's start era is treated as already-happened and excluded from the roll table — **BUT** the official ruling (`fed` POST 524) also means a start year *past* an era wrongly **loses** that era's still-pending content (an **1800-start game wrongly loses the Louisiana Purchase**). **Batch 7 LIVE-CONFIRMS this exact bug:** `rep1800` §A POST 2668 — the GM found the LA Purchase was filed under the prior Era of Federalism and "not included" for an 1800-start game; he hand-added it in 1816. Same bug, **merged** (the era-events-predating-start-DROPPED hole is the same defect, not a new row). Latent today; **a blocker the moment a 3rd scenario (1788/1800) ships** — so this rides with E1. **Resolve together with QW10 (DH-30 min-floor) + DH-2 + divergence #4** (one scheduling surface, at E15). | — | XS | bug BUG-1 (`fed` 521-535; **`rep1800` §A 2668 LIVE-confirms**), DH-2 (`modern` 2221) — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF (2 era) | ready |
| QW2 | **BUG-3 — no-PM-General fallback guard** | Defensive guard on the `GeneralInChief` fill path (`phaseRunners.ts:2255`): empty-pool ⇒ leave vacant + log (or auto-generate a stopgap officer — ties to E8 procedural pol gen). Closes a potential crash. | — | XS | bug BUG-3 (`fed` 5, 119) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW3 | **±3-per-phase meter-swing clamp (meter-model divergence; now confirmed live by `drums` #80)** | One-helper change: clamp every `NationalMeters` write to ±3 per phase (`types.ts:1399`). **Batch 5 extends this:** apply the same clamp to **cabinet ideology net-swings** and **per-phase ideology swings** at the same chokepoint (#80, `drums` POST 4574 — a live designer patch). Orthogonal to the full named-ordinal relabel (parked) and to E6's crisis/cascade rules (which build on it). Cheap balance/feel win. **★ Batch-11 — the ±3 cap is now UNCONDITIONALLY READY (no longer gated on any fork).** Batch 10 flagged the cap as the "settled half" of the #18/#51 fork; the `arkzag` continuation then **RESOLVED the #51 enthusiasm-SHIFT step** (the 4-step rule, verbatim `drums` — now at **E23, `ready`**), so the cap binds with no open dependency. **This QW3 clamp on `NationalMeters` writes is buildable NOW**, and the same ±3 cap on ideology+party-pref swings **ships with E6 at `calcStateVote` `phaseRunners.ts:3709-3711`** (which today applies enthusiasm UNIFORMLY with **NO ±3 cap and NO per-state penalty**). **The ONLY piece still BLOCKED on a human pick is #18's meter→election STATE SCOPE** (every-state-unless-penalized vs ideology-leaning-states-only — recorded under "Decision-gated", folds into E20/E23); the cap itself and the enthusiasm-SHIFT engine are NOT gated. | — | XS | meter model §21.8/§22.1/§22.2 (`1772s`; `modern`; **`drums` #80 POST 4574**) + **#51 ±3 cap settled (`dem1820`; `arkzag` ch33 2438-2456)** — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF | ready |
| QW4 | **Auto-Carpetbagger on alt-state moves (divergence #2)** | Replace the 4-step probability ladder with auto-grant on a successful alt-state relocation; add 10-year expiry + exempt alt-state moves from the relocation cap (now 4/half-term after QW0). More legible; removes a dead dial. | QW0 (the cap value) | XS | gap #38, divergence #2 (`gilded` 36; `1772s` 3-52; `modern` 147; `hd` I-1; **`drums` POSTS 2627, 2630-2634, 2755, 7465 add the per-roll % table + recent-state filter**) — HI-CONF (5 era) | ready |
| QW5 | **DH-3 — bar career-track pols from the presidency** | Add a guard at presidential-candidate eligibility (and CPU presidential selection) so career-track pols can't run — closing a GM-acknowledged rules gap (career-track is already barred from Gov/Rep/leadership/Kingmaker). Relates to the primary (E22) but is a cheap standalone guard now. | — | XS | DH-3 (`hd` 8205-8219; relates to #63) — CARRIED | ready |
| QW6 | **DH-5 — Kingmaker-pairing dissolution on flip** | A rule in the conversion path: converting/flipping a Kingmaker no longer seizes his protégés (or their +1 election standing) — flagged "insanely OP." Same code area as Reconstruction amnesty (E3b prunes broken Kingmaker pairs). Cheap balance fix on shipped Kingmaker/conversion machinery (`KINGMAKER_RULES` `types.ts:295`, `CONVERSION_ODDS` `:268`). | — | XS–S | DH-5 (`hd` 7589, 8762; relates to #29/#30) — CARRIED | ready |

Tyler patched this mid-run (POST 5437) to solve CPU stagnation in long campaigns. **Pure tunable; no shape change; cheap.** | — | XS | #85 (`drums` 2493, 5437, 6469; **★★ `terror2000` corroborates the 5%/half-term retire-death + military-officer schedule from a modern angle**) — CARRIED, HI-CONF | ready |
| **QW8** | **DH-24 — Senate-class verifier at K4 boot pipeline** *(NEW, batch 6)* | A one-helper `validateSenateClasses(snap)` that, at scenario-boot time AND at `loadStandardDraftClasses` (`standardDraftClasses.ts:13`), checks each sitting senator's last-election year against their assigned Senate class (I/II/III) and flags mismatches. `pop` POST 272/297/298: a fresh modern boot's seed data had Ron Johnson (WI) up in 2010 instead of 2012; GM had to swap classes mid-election. **One pure validator helper, run at K4's boot pipeline.** Lands at the K4 boot pipeline (does NOT require K4 to be fully built — can ship as a standalone helper now, then wire into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline when K4 lands). **★ Batch-10 — corroborated AGAIN from a 4th start year:** `dem1820`'s 1820 boot/sheet data shipped with wrong Senate-class assignment (`scenario1856.ts:86` does a naive assign; the 1856-hardcoded rotation lives at `phaseRunners.ts:3885`), so the validator is now a 2-start-confirmed XS boot-pipeline check — it belongs **inside** `scenarioBoot` (#115), not just adjacent to it. | — (helper); wires into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline (#115) when K4 lands | XS | DH-24 (`pop` 272, 297, 298; **`dem1820` reconfirms** — naive assign `scenario1856.ts:86`, rotation `phaseRunners.ts:3885`) — NEW + RECONFIRMED, HI-CONF (2 start) | ready |

Today `TRAIT_CONFLICTS` is consulted only on **trait-ADD events**, not on dataset/boot import — so boot/seed data can ship a pol with both `Integrity` AND `Controversial` (`pop` POST 1139: Quinn). **One pure validator helper.** Same pattern as QW8 — can ship now as a standalone helper, then wire into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline (#115). **★ Batch-10 — reconfirmed:** `dem1820`'s boot/sheet data again shipped trait-conflict + demographic corruption, so this validator belongs inside `scenarioBoot` alongside QW8. | — (helper); wires into the `scenarioBoot` pipeline (#115) when K4 lands | XS | DH-27 (`pop` 1139; `types.ts:658`; **`dem1820` reconfirms**) — NEW + RECONFIRMED | ready |

(A rejected alt — hard year-windows per event — was declined because *"events not happening every playthrough has been explicitly stated to be how the game operates"*, load-bearing for alt-history.) **Same scheduling surface as BUG-1 + divergence #4** — land it alongside QW1 / at E15. Small, additive; no new save shape. | — (pairs with QW1; full scheduling fork resolved at E15) | XS | DH-30 (`rep1800` §A 2918, 2919-2932; companion to BUG-1) — NEW | ready |

### Engine track — Phase 0 (keystones)

**`K0 → (K1 ‖ K2 ‖ K3) → K4 ‖ K5`.** After K0, K1/K2/K3 are independent and
parallelizable across PRs; K4 depends on K3. **K5 is a new late-keystone (batch
5)** — sits after K0 + K2, parallel with K3/K4 + federalism (§9.1.3). K2 remains
the single most important keystone (~6× leverage) — **do it first if only one
lands**, because K5 depends on it (most handlers pick from a registry).
**Batch-4: per-era point BANKING (#68) is folded into K3/K4 — not a new item.**
**★ Batch-7: the era-model reframe RE-SPECS K3 + K4 — NOT a new keystone** (§9.1.5
/ divergence #18). `advanceEra` becomes condition-driven (game-state / meter /
TERRITORY, per half-term — no `target` arg); content gates on `game.eraBand` + a
new `territoryOwned` predicate, not the calendar; early sub-bands are content-band
markers. **No new keystones this batch.** See the updated K3 + K4 rows.
**★★ Batch-8: K3 + K4 are now MULTI-SAVE PROVEN — the HIGHEST-confidence large bet
in the roadmap** (§9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump). Two independent saves —
`tea1772` (1772-start) and `rep1800` (1800-start, 28 in-game years apart) — emit
the **identical era-band sequence at identical in-game dates** (game-context #102),
so the content-band model is **settled, not speculative**. **Nothing structural
changes** (the K3/K4 spec was already condition-driven from batch 7); this is a
**confidence/priority raise only** — if engine staffing is scarce, K3/K4 are the
safest era investment to start. **#102's dual era-scoring (per-era winner +
cumulative "winner so far") is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard** — it folds into
K3/K4's per-era point-banking (#68 banks the cumulative total; the win condition is
**DUAL**), NOT a new item. **No new keystones this batch either.**
**★★ Batch-9: K3/K4 are now 3-START-CONFIRMED (1772 + 1800 + 1948) and gain a
TWO-LEVEL refinement + a structured-era-event-data requirement — still NOT a new
keystone, NO re-sequence** (§9.1.5 updated, BINDING). The band model holds across a
THIRD start year (1948, `nuke`), and `nuke` splits it into **two distinct,
separately-fired mechanics that an earlier extractor conflated — BOTH must be built;
do NOT collapse them:** **(a) point-banked Historical Eras** (the #92/#68 content-band
mechanic) that carry **RULE-DELTAS, not just content** (the Era-of-Terror cabinet
rework — region stops mattering, replaced by diversity + faction-balance checks — is
the proof bands change rules); **(b) within-era decade/census boundaries** = a
**separate, schedule-fired** per-decade `AMPU Census` doing **bulk EV reallocation +
wholesale state-bias re-lean + content rotation** — distinct from #68's per-era
bias-table swap (it fires on a 10-yr calendar schedule WITHIN a band). PLUS **K4's
era-event data needs STRUCTURED `evDelta`/census fields (DH-48)** + per-era
completeness validation (the Neocon census/EV-delta events were LOST as free-text
flavor). **Logged correction: "Neocons"/"Corporate Republicans" is a FACTION REBRAND
(~1980), NOT an era band** — do not promote any faction nickname to a Historical Era.
These land **entirely inside K3 (the census-as-a-second-schedule + the rule-delta
hooks) and K4 (the structured era-event data + validators)** — no new keystone, no
re-order. See the updated K3 + K4 rows.
**★ Batch-9: K2 confidence — the per-half-term phase loop is now corroborated at
~25 sub-phases** (`nuke` walks the full 2.1.x→2.10 loop a 4th time across a 1948
campaign), reinforcing that the ActionRegistry (K2) is the right shared host for the
six+ action libraries the loop drives. No scope change; confidence only.
**★ Batch-9: K5 is now LOAD-BEARING, not optional/late (§9.1.3 priority bump,
BINDING).** `nuke` carries the designer's strongest design-intent statement (#114,
§28.12): the **APP is built for 1-human-vs-9-CPU** (multiplayer "goes off the rails";
the points system is for the CPUs, not humans). The app is a **solo adaptation of a
multiplayer game**, so the ENTIRE multiplayer apparatus (party-leader elections,
conversions, kingmaker pairings, committee assignment, cross-faction endorsements,
forced 3rd-party runs, the whole convention) **must be CPU-AI-driven** — and `nuke`
confirms that surface was **entirely UNEXERCISED** by the human playtest (it must be
authored from spec). **This does NOT re-sequence K5** (it still lands after K0 + K2,
parallel with K3/K4 + federalism) — but it raises K5 + the handler suite (E9) from
"force-multiplier" to **the load-bearing system that makes the product playable solo
at all.** Treat the handler suite as a first-class Phase-1 system.
**★★ Batch-10: K4 absorbs the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` PIPELINE — the most-requested
missing item (#115) — at the FRONT of the subsystem queue; still NOT a new keystone,
NO re-sequence** (§9.1.9, BINDING). `dem1820` records that **there are NO documented
rules for CREATING a game** — and verified shipped-state has NO shared boot
abstraction (`startNewGame` `GameContext.tsx:264` switches a literal into hand-
authored builders; `scenario1856.ts:44-214` seats Congress with raw `Math.random`).
So **build one pure `scenarioBoot(BootSheet): FullGameSnapshot` pipeline inside K4's
`BootSheet` schema**, in dependency order **K0 (seed boot rolls) → `scenarioBoot` +
`BootSheet` (with K4) → every scenario becomes a data row** — and build it **WITH the
first new scenario (`scenario1788` / E1), before the third hand-authored copy-paste.**
It is the venue for the XS boot validators (QW8/QW9) + the appointment-ladder
(#115b). See the updated K4 row.
**★ Batch-10: K3/K4 are now 4-START-CONFIRMED** (1772 `tea1772` + 1800 `rep1800` +
**1820 `dem1820`** + 1948 `nuke` all emit the band model — `dem1820`'s draft table
prints "Era of Democracy (1820-1840)" → "Manifest Destiny (1840-1856)", POST 946).
**Confidence bump only — no scope change, no re-order.**
**★ Batch-11: K3/K4's #92 model is now LIVE-EXERCISED end-to-end** — `arkzag` (the same
1820 save run forward to 1840) plays the era/territory content-gate live: the **tariff-
rate-change cooldown to 1836** (POST 928), **Minister-to-Japan creatable by exec action
ONLY in the Manifest-Destiny era** (POST 359), "military academy"/"state university"
gated to later eras (ch5) — AND it surfaces the **concrete defect that the territory
filter is MISSING** (DH-60: "Force Open Trade with Japan" fired with no Pacific port;
"Stubborn Cherokee" without owning the territory, POST 335-340), which lands as the
`requires?: Predicate` era-event gate at **E15 + BUG-1** (reusing K3's `territoryOwned`
predicate). **Confidence bump + DH-60 placement only — no scope change, no re-order, no
keystone move.**
**★★ Batch-24 (two founding-era runs — `grass1772` + `rookie1772`) — K5's JUSTIFICATION is now
the STRONGEST in the corpus; NO re-sequence, NO scope change, NO keystone move.** Both runs DIED
to the manual CPU-faction sim + opaque rules — `grass1772` because **2 humans couldn't hand-run 8
CPU factions** (`#POST 328`, fixed by ADDING humans to offload the CPU work) and `rookie1772` to
GM time-burnout, the **strongest onboarding signal in the KB** (a rookie walls on phase-processing
/ meter-prereqs / phase-order / Lingering "never run before… more complicated than expected,"
`#POST 1370`). With `modernday` + `pop2012b` this is the **4th GM-burnout death**. K5 + the E9
handler suite are exactly the **#114 CPU-AI that makes the app playable solo** (one human runs ONE
faction); grep `cpuHandler|handlerSuite|runCpuFaction` in `src/` = ZERO. **Raise K5's priority/
confidence ONLY — its placement (after K0+K2, parallel with K3/K4) is unchanged.** Pairs with the
DH-69 onboarding/legal-move surface (the same legal-move enumerator a CPU action-picker needs).

Used by **six+** action libraries (governor/exec/diplomacy/convention-inter-ballot/primary/general — plus the Reconstruction readmission-plan + secession-trigger rows at E3b). **~6× tax if built ad-hoc — the highest-leverage keystone.** **Hard prerequisite for K5** — most CPU handlers pick from a registry library. **Batch 6: the `GameAction<Ctx>` shape gains a `requires?: AmendmentPredicate` field from day one** (divergence #16). One extra field + one filter step in the picker reading `game.amendments.passed`. Canonical instance: the general-election action "Send VP to Shore Up Support" requires the 12th Amendment. Same `requires:` mechanism gates bill catalog entries (income-tax category) + gov action rows; predicate lives at the registry-row level, not the library level. **Cheap if early, expensive if retrofit** across 6 libraries. **Resolve DH-9 (canonical action ability-stat) before the `resolve` signatures harden.** | K0 | S | §6.6 (now confirmed **5 eras**; `hd` adds the Reconstruction/exec rows; `drums` raises the consumer count to 6+; **`pop` POST 951 adds `requires?` field for divergence #16**) + DH-9 — CARRIED + EXTENDED, HI-CONF (5 era) | ready |

Verified: phases gate by `year % 4` / `year % 2` (`phases.ts:49-59`) — those are **correct for CADENCE and STAY**; there is **no year→era derivation anywhere** (`currentEra` is a plain field), so this is a **generalization of the one existing trigger, not a rewrite**. **★ Gate all content (bills / era-events / draftees / bias-table) on `game.eraBand` + a NEW `territoryOwned` predicate, NOT literal year** — un-owned-land content is invalid (Louisiana-born pols un-playable until LA is owned; this is the mechanism that *forces* `rep1800`'s ~30-yr content lag). **One new `territoryOwned(snap, requirement)` predicate** (a `Predicate` variant + one `evalPredicate` case at `eraGraph.ts:12`), **three consumers** (bill catalog, era-event walker, draft pool — the draft pool also excludes pols whose state/territory is un-owned/unorganized, = §27.5's gate). **The bank-and-zero boot pipeline (#68) fires AT the content-band boundary wherever it lands on the calendar:** bank the running per-era `Faction.score` into `eraPointBanks?: Record<Era,…>` + zero the running total, pay end-of-era awards, re-run pre-turn phases (2.1.x→2.3.1), swap content pools (card-pool + per-era card-count rescale, draft profile, SCOTUS set, nation renames, party-formation, **per-era state-bias table wholesale**). The per-era banks **sum toward the (open) cross-era win total**. Lift the **5** `ERA_GRAPH_1772` spots in `eraGraph.ts` (`:4,:73,:113,:148,:164`) to `ERA_GRAPHS: Record<Era, GraphNode[]>`. **No new top-level field beyond an optional `game.eraBand` marker (can reuse `currentEra`).** **RECONCILES #68 point-banking + §26 BootSheet boot model + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE era system** (debt #5/#9 dissolve here). **★ Batch-8 — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN (HIGHEST confidence, no scope change):** the content-band sequence is corroborated by TWO independent saves (`tea1772` 1772-start + `rep1800` 1800-start, 28 in-game years apart, identical bands at identical dates — #102), so the condition-driven model is settled, not speculative. **The per-era banks feed the DUAL win-condition scoreboard (#102): a per-era winner AND a cumulative "winner so far"** — the bank-and-zero already computes both (the running total is the cumulative scoreboard), so this is a labeling/exposure concern, NOT new banking logic. **★ Batch-9 — TWO-LEVEL refinement (3-START-CONFIRMED; §9.1.5), still inside K3:** the era model has **two distinct, separately-fired mechanics — build BOTH, do NOT collapse them.** **(a) The point-banked Historical Eras (the `advanceWhen` content-bands above) carry RULE-DELTAS, not just content** — the Era-of-Terror cabinet rework (region stops mattering → diversity + faction-balance checks) proves a band can change *rules*, so the boundary pipeline must support per-band rule-delta hooks, not only pool/bias swaps. **(b) A SEPARATE per-decade `AMPU Census` mechanic, schedule-fired (NOT a band boundary):** every ~10 in-game years it does **bulk EV reallocation vs the prior census + wholesale state-bias re-lean (Blue5..Tossup..Red5) + content rotation** (draft pool / lobby cards / era-activated industries) — distinct from #68's per-era bias swap (which fires at a band boundary). The census needs a per-state population model + House cap (parking-lot DH-49) before it can compute EV deltas. **Era CONTENT (events/SCOTUS docket) fires on yet a THIRD clock — a scripted ~5%/phase schedule decoupled from in-game history (#109)** — reinforcing §6.4: bands gate on game-state, the census fires on a 10-yr schedule, content fires on its own clock. **Logged correction: "Neocons" is a faction-rebrand at a census boundary, NOT a band — do not model it as one.** **★★ Batch-22 (`modernday`, game-mechanics §27.2.1) — the #68/#2 banking pipeline now has a CURRENT-RULES LIVE INSTANCE → SPEC-ANCHOR CONFIRMED (no priority change, no scope change).** `modernday` is the **first KB instance of the 6-clause end-of-era point-banking ritual firing at a REAL boundary under CURRENT rules** — the 2024 "Era of Populism"→"Near Future" transition (`#POST 1871`), with the formula printed VERBATIM: **most-points +5 / other-party-most +3 / 2nd-most-same-party +3 / all-factions-in-top-party +3 each / two −1 allied-faction-finished-last guards**; plus the **non-banked score RESET** ("Scores will be reset to zero for the next Era", #51/#2), the **faction-trade/switch window** (`#POST 1874`), and the **procedural-content swap** (historical imports → all-generated rookies, `#POST 1902/1909` — the #43/E8 dataset-exhaustion boundary). It **matches `rep1800` almost exactly**, so #68/#2 is now confirmed a deterministic pipeline from BOTH a 1800 AND a current-rules angle — the bank-and-zero spec above is well-anchored for when this row builds it.

### Engine track — Phase 1 (subsystems, dependency-ordered)

Ordered exactly per tech-lead §9.6 to minimize rework. The federalism /
early-republic epic (E1) is one spine; **E3b (Civil War / Reconstruction) is the
second — it completes the already-shipped 1856 scenario** and sits right after
generic war (E3) + K2, **not** behind federalism or the modern tail (§9.1.2).
**Batch-7 additions: E4 folds in the 12A legislature-elector toggle; new E4b is
the early-republic cluster** (slavery-flag+Cohens / Second Bank+Bank War /
statehood-by-bill+territory-gate); **new E5b (ideology-as-circle) is the
foundational central-helper refactor placed early** (§9.1.7). Rows **E6–E8** are
the **NEAR-TERM cross-cutting items the modern thread pulled forward** — not
modern-only. **E9 is the CPU handler suite — 15 lightweight PRs once K5 lands;
~~★★ E9 handler #2 is the gate on E3b's Reconstruction readmission half (DH-29).~~
★★ BATCH-16 UPDATE: #156's "plan adopted by Congress OR President" prerequisite lets
the player-President adopt a plan UNILATERALLY via the K2 exec path, so E3b's
readmission half NO LONGER HARD-depends on E9 handler #2 FOR THE SOLO CASE — handler
#2's CPU default-vote bias is now an ENHANCEMENT for the Congress-driven readmission
path, not a solo gate (DH-29 reframed structural + fixed by #156).**
**Batch-8 fold-ins (no new rows, no re-order):** **#100** SCOTUS-overturns-an-
amendment + amendable-threshold → E5 (amendments) + E25 (SCOTUS docket); **#103**

**★ Batch-9 fold-ins (no new rows, no re-order — CONFIDENCE + NEGATIVE-SCOPE + small
placements):** the "Cold War" is **NOT a new epic** — it is **E3 (generic war)
RELABELED + E12 (diplomacy) + content (data on K4)** (§9.1.8). The two REAL items
under the label are already on the roadmap and gain hard build-holes: **E3 must
RESOLVE — DH-47: wars NEVER end today (Korea ran ~2 decades) → build a real
resolution/peace path (couples to DH-12 white-peace) + ideally army/navy/air
BRANCHES** (army generals command navies today); and **E12 (diplomacy) is the real
modern foreign subsystem — 8 relation meters + ambassador actions + DH-46 downward
pressure (the US ends up allied with everyone) + DH-45 fix the USSR-collapse trigger
chain (stalls at a ~5% gate) + a Cold-War ≤Neutral cap on USSR/China.** **E16 extends
to CREATE-AND-ABOLISH cabinet seats** (DOE/DHS created, **Postmaster General
ABOLISHED**, HEW split — `Legislation.abolishesCabinetSeat?`). The **modern
election/institutional layer** folds into existing rows: **#105** stat-collapse →
forced resignation + **DH-54** impeachment/VP-vacancy/succession ruleset →
**E10b/E29** (DH-54 author-before-build); **legislated variable SCOTUS size +

**#110** modern election machine → **E20/E23**; **#113** Era-of-Terror content →
E30 (data). DH placements: **DH-50/53** era-event scheduling + bill-catalog → E15 /
E2; **DH-52** landslide-margin-cap (no close elections) → E20 balance; **DH-51**

## Later / parking lot

Bigger, fuzzier, deferred, or **needs-design-before-build**.

### Author-before-build (design tasks — a PM/design job, not a `/build-feature` run)

These have **no rules to build to yet**; the rules must be **authored first**, then
they fold into the engine row noted.

> **★★ Batch-20 — #168 is a PRE-BUILD AUTHORING-QUALITY PASS, NOT a scheduled code task (and
> NOT counted in the author-before-build total — there ARE rules; the work is standardize-and-

> It produces: **(a)** a **terminology contract** the build must honor — ideology short forms
> (`LW Pop/Prog/Lib/Mod/Cons/Trad/RW Pop`, matching the `types.ts` 7-point scale), the Skills/
> levels/Experience/Interests vocabulary, the military-Experience → **"Army" rename** (a
> `dbomit` corroboration — "Army" is mislabeled as a *starting expertise*, should be Military),
> **human-rights → "criminal reform"**, demographic-category standardization (add Middle
> Eastern ethnicity, drop the no-op Protestant/White defaults, **"Crazy" trait permanently
> REJECTED — use Controversial**); **(b)** a **branch-path / meter-direction / %-multiplier

> everything else is edited from 1772 forward) and **all changes route through vcczar**
> (`planb#POST 37, 72`). **So per-era CONTENT authoring should be sequenced CHRONOLOGICALLY —

> ENGINE track (keystones/subsystems stay dependency-ordered). A scheduling note, not a build
> item. game-mechanics §30.11.1. **★ Batch 9 adds TWO NEW author-before-build
items → 12 total:** **DH-49** — a **POPULATION MODEL + House cap** (the one
genuinely-NEW infrastructure item this batch: the per-decade census EV-reallocation
[K3 level (b)] and the Wyoming-Rule apportionment [E28] are un-implementable without
a per-state population model + a House-size cap, and **neither exists today** —
`State.electoralVotes` is a static seed; author it OR size it into the
census/apportionment epic E28 as its first sub-task); and **DH-54** — an
**impeachment / VP-vacancy / succession ruleset** (never in the rules doc across 3
campaigns; corroborates DH-33; folds into E10b + E29). **Batch 8 added ONE:**
**DH-41** — the general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade (UNBUILT,
`vcczar`-deferred; folds into the SCOTUS docket E25 once decided). **Batch 7 added
ONE:** DH-33 impeachment-ruleset rewrite (folds into E29) — plus a separate
**roadmap DECISION** (DH-34 static-era-biases — *resolved: ship static*; see the
note below, it is **not** an author task). **Batch 6 added ONE BLOCKER:** DH-25
career-track bootstrap (3-yr-stale design discussion; **BLOCKS Phase-2 modern
scenarios E30 + E31**). **Batch 5 added six items:** contingent-election rules
(#10/#84 is the biggest), §25.9 Iron-Fist split, DH-12 white-peace, DH-13
faithless-elector cap, DH-14 era-aware bill ideology, DH-15 small-state action
multiplier. **Batch 10 adds NO new author-before-build items** — its one new gap
(#115) is a buildable pipeline folded into K4 (not a rules-authoring hole), and the
**#115b** appointment-ladder is an XS item owned inside K4/E16. **Batch 11 adds NO
new author-before-build items either** — its two new gaps (#116 economic engine →
E4c, #119 amendment lifecycle → E5) are buildable subsystems, #61's succession ENGINE
is ready-to-build (its line-of-succession/impeachment half is the ALREADY-LISTED
**DH-54**), and DH-59/DH-60 are sized bug-folds. **★ Batch 12 adds ONE new author-
before-build item → 13 total: #122 PARDON MECHANICS** (entirely unspecified — no
rules in the doc; per Bushwa777 `smallbugs#POST 113`, what gets undone when a pres
pardons a Controversial pol with a scandal: trait, election malus, impeachment-
disqualification? what political cost on the pardoner? Pairs with the impeachment
machinery #112 + the resignation-while-impeached penalty pipeline + the cabinet-
Scandalous-Office-Holder loop; **author-time decision, no ruling yet** — folds into
**E29** when authored). The OTHER 18 batch-12 Ted-rulings are RULED + slotted (not
author-before-build), and #120/#121/#123 are dataset/content additions (not author-
before-build). **★ Batch 13 adds NO new author-before-build items** — its
buildable prerequisites (**DH-61** boot-seed active wars → K4 pipeline, **DH-62**
pre-12A EC mode → E4) are sized engine work that lands WITH E1, not rules-authoring
holes; **#143** is a RULED XS quick-win (QW17); the **#61 death-branch** is RULED
(re-scopes E10b); and its TWO open design calls (**OC-4** off-ideology draft gate,
**OC-8** define-an-office) go to the **designer-gated** Decision sub-bucket (waiting on
Ted/vcczar), NOT the author-before-build list. **★ Batch 14 adds NO new author-before-build
items either** — all five `gild1868` deltas are buildable engine work: **#147/#149/#150 +
DH-63** are the EG gilded-era content epic (downstream subsystems gated on K3/K4 + #116/E4c
+ #42, NOT rules-authoring holes), and **#148** is a sized S–M extension of E3b (the 20-yr
Reconstruction timer + appoint-by-Speaker/PPT-faction + Solid-South sunset). The Gilded
era + `scenario1868` is K4 content (#41/E22). **★ Batch 15 adds NO new author-before-build
items either** — all four `terror2000` deltas are buildable engine work (#18 → ready-to-build
E20b; #88 → E6; #152 → E3; #124+#151 → E16's 3rd re-scope; #153 → QW18; #154 → E16), and the
#18/#88 RESOLUTIONS plus the #124-percentages RESOLUTION are all settled-in-thread, not
rules-authoring holes. **Total author-before-build items: 13** (UNCHANGED)
(DH-1, #10/#84, §25.9, DH-12, DH-13, DH-14, DH-15, DH-25, DH-33, DH-41, **DH-49**,
**DH-54**, **#122 pardon mechanics batch-12**). **Decision-gated category — ★★ batch-15
RECOUNT −2: User-gated 2 (#52 + delegate-class — #18 state-scope RESOLVED OUT to V's
2-layer model → E20b) + Designer-gated 10 logical / 9 bullets (the #124-percentages gate,
B8+B9, RESOLVED OUT via the live 3-state tuning → E16).** Prior framing: batch 10 introduced
the category (#52 + #18/#51); the **#51 enthusiasm-SHIFT fork was RESOLVED** (`arkzag`
4-step → E23) and a **delegate-class fork ARRIVED**; batch 12 split it into user-gated +
designer-gated; **batch 15 removes #18 (user) + #124-percentages (designer).** See the
**"Decision-gated"** subsection below for the full per-bucket detail.

- **DH-1 — filibustered "MUST-pass" bill remedy (needs-design).** A required
  bill filibustered to death has no rulebook remedy; the GM improvised a
  4-leader special-committee auto-pass with a per-day "shutdown" penalty clock.
  **Author the deadlock-resolution rule** (forced-compromise vs shutdown-clock
  vs fallback auto-pass), then build into **E14c (filibuster) / E29**. — DH-1,
  debt #21 (`modern` 640-716).
- **Divergence #10 / #84 — Contingent-election rules don't exist (NEW, batch 5).**
  GM Tyler invented **5 candidate rulesets** to settle 1848 tie (`drums` POSTS
  472-474): party-line state vote / faction-first then party / Speaker-Min-
  Leader-controls-state / momentum+swaying / state modifiers. All 5 favored
  Fillmore; GM picked #4 (momentum) to keep play moving. **Author rules
  BEFORE build:** (a) top-2 vs top-3 (DH-6: GM used top-2); (b) outgoing-vs-
  incoming Congress (GM nebulous, used incoming POSTS 4467-4475); (c) deadlock
  side-effects (EBR POST 5250: Controversial gain on elected Pres + 50/50 Dom
  Stab hit); plus 17 state delegations for Pres + 33 Senate for VP (POST 810).
  **Bundles with hd #62 at E10b.** — #10/#84/DH-6 (`drums` 472-474, 810,
  4467-4475, 5176, 5217-5221, 5250).
- **§25.9 — Iron-Fist exact split shape (NEW, batch 5).** The 6 office-keyed
  child trait names + cascade rules need a designer call before build. §25.9
  lists 6 candidate effects (PL+Honest-Gov-maxed gov control; Sen Maj Leader
  vote forcing; President officer-fire / SCOTUS-compel / challenger-stifle;
  Loans-from-Wealthy + IF PL gov takeover; Convention PL unilateral threshold;
  mid-war military replacement) but the **exact names** and **what cascades to
  what** are open. Author the split, then build **E17**. — gap #77 + §25.9
  (`drums` 2433-7364).
- **DH-12 — White-peace rules MISSING from the war system (NEW, batch 5).**
  Tyler (`drums` POSTS 6533-6541): *"There are, in fact, no rules about white
  peace"* — had to dig up old treaty docs. **Author the spec** (Moderate
  Implementation Pres+Sec State+Sec War; 75% −1 Party Pref; −100 Mil-Industry;
  −500 Expansionists; −500 President; return to antebellum status quo), then
  fold into **E3** (generic war) / **E3b** (Civil-War readmission). — DH-12.
- **DH-13 — Faithless-elector trigger cap (NEW, batch 5).** Current trigger
  fires "whenever winner's state has the other party's ideology enthusiasm
  maxed" — over-aggressive (`drums` POSTS 466, 469-471, 2912, 4441): 1876
  produced 22 faithless from Cobb + 12 from Fremont; 1892 produced 8 Whig →
  232-232 tie → House contingent; 1900 had an 8-elector defection. **Author
  the documented + capped trigger** (e.g. max-N per state + state-modifier
  table) + the EBR deadlock side-effect rule (POST 5250). Folds into **E26**
  3rd-party or a per-(state) cap inside the EC tally. — DH-13.
- **DH-14 — Bill ideology impacts not era-aware (NEW, batch 5).** Matt
  (`drums` POSTS 6691, 6878, 6912): Mods need to be removed from the
  negative-points side of Women's Suffrage in 1916 — should be era-sensitive.
  Tyler agreed. **Equal Voting Rights for Women never passes** (60.5% / 63.6%
  short of 2/3): GM: *"This amendment will never pass in a game with CPUs."*
  **Author the era-keyed bill ideology impact tables**, then fold into the bill
  catalog (E14 / E20). — DH-14.
- **DH-15 — Small/large-state action-impact multiplier UNCODIFIED (batch 5).**
  Tyler (`drums` POSTS 6676-6680): *"Since RI is a small state he would only
  succeed on impacting the meter at 2.5% [half of 5%]; large states double."*
  In playtest sheets ("Effects Meters?" column) but **not codified in the gov
  actions section of the rulebook**. **Author the multiplier rule + the
  small/large-state classification table**, then fold into **E11** (governor
  actions). — DH-15.
- **DH-25 — Career-track bootstrap unresolved (NEW, batch 6 — BLOCKS Phase-2
  modern scenarios E30 + E31).** Lars (`pop` POST 33): *"we've legit been
  having this discussion for almost three years now and somehow we've yet to
  change the rulebook or the game."* For a mid-game boot, the question is
  "which existing pols start on career tracks (Foreign / Military /
  Industrial / Academic / Bureaucrat) at boot?" — and no canonical rule
  exists. **Zagnut's houserule on the table:** anyone drafted in 1996+ goes
  onto one track each (POST 31). Rodja hand-populated by GM ad-hoc (POST 38,
  50). **Author the bootstrap rule before `scenario1948` (E30) or
  `scenario2012` (E31) ships** — both are gated on it. **The single biggest
  parking-lot item from batch 6.** **★ Batch-10 — `dem1820` reconfirms + sharpens
  this AND surfaces the SELF-CONTRADICTION (#86/DH-25/DH-56):** the 1820 GA seeded the
  **inaugural career-track from the LAST-3 DRAFT CLASSES** (1820/1816/1812, POST 28) —
  a concrete bootstrap variant for the rule to choose among — and exposed that **2.1
  says career-track pols "can't run or be appointed" while many sections pull them by
  election/appointment** (the GA ruled to ignore the bar — a friction point in the
  DH-36 burnout). **Author ONE coherent career-track-eligibility rule here too** (run/
  appoint allowed or not), since the boot pipeline (#115) and the appointment-ladder
  (#115b) both depend on it. **★ The appointment-ladder (#115b) PAIRS WITH this item
  (XS, into the boot/appointment rules):** when a seat must be appointment-filled at
  boot, the deterministic ladder is **own-party-not-CT → own-party-CT → opposite-not-CT
  → opposite-CT → generate** (the order the GA improvised); it lives in `scenarioBoot`
  (#115 / K4) once this CT-eligibility rule is authored. **★★ Batch-18 (#163,
  `ideo1928`) — a THIRD bootstrap-variant data-point:** the GA pre-placed randomized
  statesmen onto career tracks at game start (by draft-cohort + ability) to fix the
  "generational pols stuck at floor stats" problem (the **Buttigieg problem**, POST
  32-41) — a GA house rule (NOT designer-authoritative) that joins this parking-lot
  item as another variant for the canonical rule to choose among (alongside Zagnut's
  "1996+ → one track each" and the 1820 last-3-draft-classes seed). The companion
  **#164 mid-government start-state question** (POST 184-188) folds into K4's
  `BootSheet` start-state field, not here. — DH-25 (+ #115b appointment-ladder;
  `dem1820` POST 28; #86/DH-56 CT-eligibility self-contradiction; **+ #163 career-track
  pre-placement house rule `ideo1928` POST 32-41**).
- **DH-33 — Impeachment ruleset broken/outdated (NEW, batch 7).** The
  impeachment mini-flow runs but the canonical rules are flagged
  non-functional / improvised — `rep1800` corroborates `hd`'s "impeachment
  super outdated and doesn't work" across a **2nd campaign** (an Integrity
  justice got accused of bribery — nonsensical; only **resignation** avoids
  the DomStab/Honest-Gov drop). **Author the impeachment rewrite before
  building it into E29** (modern legislative depth). — DH-33 (`rep1800` §A
  465-474; §B 3594, 3620; corroborates `hd` DH-14-impeachment).
- **★ DH-41 — general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade (NEW, batch 8
  — the headline batch-8 author-before-build item).** `tea1772` POST 124-126: a
  spectator argued **Prigg v. Pennsylvania** should auto-void the Fugitive Slave
  Act; `vcczar` **deferred** — *"V will need to think about it."* This is
  **distinct from the *built* strike-a-single-law** (`tea1772` POST 770-784) **and
  from #100's overturn-an-amendment-on-review** — it is the **general cascade**: a
  ruling that *contradicts a law on the books*. **Today a contradicting ruling
  leaves the law operative.** A genuinely undesigned policy: does the ruling
  void/neuter the conflicting law, or leave it operative (the current default)?
  **Author the cascade policy before building it**, then fold into the SCOTUS
  docket (**E25**). Cross-refs §24.4's *Pollock*→income-tax coupling (which IS a
  designed gate, already handled at E5/E25). — DH-41 (`tea1772` 124-126; cf. the
  built 770-784).
- **★ DH-49 — a POPULATION MODEL + House cap (NEW, batch 9 — the ONE genuinely-new
  infrastructure item this batch).** The per-decade census EV-reallocation (level
  (b) of the era model, K3 / §28.9) and the Wyoming-Rule apportionment (E28 /
  #34/#55) are **un-implementable without a real per-state population model + a
  House-size cap** — and **neither exists today** (`State.electoralVotes` is a
  static seed; there is **no population field** anywhere). Unlike most batch-9 items
  (which relabel/extend existing work), this is **new infrastructure.** **Author the
  population model + House cap before build, OR size it INTO the census/apportionment
  epic (E28) as its first sub-task.** Once it exists, the K3 census level (b) and the
  E28 Wyoming-Rule recompute both consume it. — DH-49 (`nuke` §28.9; the census +
  Wyoming-Rule items E28 / K3 depend on it).
- **★ DH-54 — impeachment / VP-vacancy / succession ruleset was NEVER in the rules
  doc (NEW, batch 9 — corroborates DH-33 across a THIRD campaign).** `nuke` (§28.5):
  there is **no impeachment trigger** (a Watergate-analog went undetected → pure
  upside) and **VP-vacancy fill was "made up as we go."** This corroborates
  `rep1800`'s DH-33 ("impeachment super outdated and doesn't work") + `hd` across a
  third campaign — the ruleset has never been written down. **Author the impeachment
  + VP-vacancy-fill + succession ruleset before building** the institutional layer:
  it gates the configurable line of succession + the acting-president gate (**E10b**)
  and the impeachment rewrite (**E29**). Pairs with #105 (stat-collapse→forced-
  resignation, the one *built-able* succession trigger). Distinct from DH-33 only in
  scope (DH-33 = "impeachment is broken"; DH-54 = "impeachment AND succession were
  never specified") — treat them as one author task. **★★ Batch-18 (DH-66, `ideo1928`)
  — now 3-THREAD-CONFIRMED BROKEN, and Ted is DRAFTING the rewrite (not yet final).**
  grep `impeach` across `src/` STILL returns ZERO — no trigger, article generation,
  trial, or removal. The "Improper SC Justice" general event triggered an impeachment
  trial that Jimmy + Ted **VOIDED mid-run** (POST 816-861) because the rules
  under-specify article generation, trial-firing, and the Controversial-vs-<3-judicial
  inconsistency; **Ted drafted a rewrite that is NOT YET FINAL.** This is the THIRD
  thread to confirm the subsystem broken (DH-33 `rep1800` + DH-54 `nuke` + DH-66
  `ideo1928`) — **STAYS author-before-build PARKING LOT; do NOT build against the
  current under-specified rules until Ted's pending rewrite lands** (game-mechanics
  §24.1.1). — DH-54 (`nuke` §28.5; cf. DH-33 `rep1800` + **DH-66 `ideo1928` POST
  816-861, 3rd-thread-confirmed, Ted-rewrite-pending**).
- **★ #122 — Pardon mechanics entirely unspecified (NEW, batch 12 — the one new
  author-before-build item this batch).** `smallbugs#POST 113` (Bushwa777):
  *"Pardon rules not spelled out. What happens if pres pardons someone? Do they
  lose traits they got like controversial? If not pardoned do they get retired from
  game?"* — **no follow-up in the thread.** Pardons interact with: (a) the
  Controversial-trait apparatus, (b) the impeachment machinery (#112), (c) the
  resignation-penalty pipeline (resignation-while-impeached = permanent −3 future
  elections / barred from appointment / loses Integrity), (d) the cabinet-
  resignation-and-Scandalous-Office-Holder loop (POST 618 — a fired pol can be re-
  appointed next phase). **Author-time decision; no ruling yet.** **Specify:** who
  can be pardoned (any non-impeached citizen?), what gets undone (Controversial
  trait? scandal trait? election malus? impeachment-disqualification?), the
  political cost (pardoning a Controversial pol = pardoner gains Controversial?
  Honest-Gov drop?). **Author the rules before building, then fold into E29**
  (modern legislative depth) + the impeachment/resignation pipeline. — #122
  (`smallbugs (cf82a7d3)` §4b POST 113).

### Decision-gated (NOT ready-to-build — split into TWO sub-buckets batch-12)

**The Decision-gated category now splits into TWO sub-buckets per the batch-12
authority-hierarchy update (Ted/vcczar > GA > inference, game-mechanics §30.4):**

- **(A) User-gated** (CARRIED — items waiting on the HUMAN's design call). These are
  NOT ready-to-build and are NOT author-before-build holes (rules EXIST — two or more
  competing models; the human picks). Then the item folds into the engine row noted.
- **(B) Designer-gated (NEW batch-12)** — items waiting on **Ted/vcczar** to close in
  `tedchange`/`smallbugs`. Ted floated each but did NOT finalize in the threads. **The
  roadmap-planner should NOT schedule these as ready-to-build until Ted/vcczar closes
  them.** Source: game-mechanics §30.2.

**Counts (★★ batch-15 recount −2):** User-gated **2 items** (#52 + delegate-class —
**#18 RESOLVED OUT**, was 3); Designer-gated **10 logical items / 9 bullets remain**
(**the #124-percentages gate — tracked as bullets B8 + B9 — RESOLVED OUT**, was 11). **★
Batch 12 added the (B) sub-bucket; ★ batch 13 added OC-4 + OC-8 to (B) (9 → 11); ★★ batch
15 removes TWO: (A) #18 state-scope is SETTLED to V's 2-layer model (`terror2000` POST
913-926) → PROMOTED to ready-to-build row E20b, and (B) the #124 numeric percentages are
LARGELY RESOLVED by the live 3-state enthusiasm tuning (`terror2000` POST 1280) → fold
into the E16 const table.** **#52 stays** (player-vs-CPU surface user-gated; the all-CPU
case is resolved by ideology-distance); **delegate-class stays** (AI-allocator vs
player-rigged, unresolved). The **−2 = #18 (user-gated) + #124-percentages (designer-gated,
the B8/B9 pair = one logical gate).** **★★ Batch-16 nets 0 — counts UNCHANGED (User-gated
2, Designer-gated 10/9):** no item enters or leaves either sub-bucket. **DH-29 was NEVER in
this category** (it was an E3b debt/DoD item, not a user/designer model fork) — vcczar
AUTHORED its fix (#156), so it moves from "debt item / open blocker" to "designed fix in
hand, build it inside E3b (d)," not into or out of Decision-gated. #156/#155/#157 are
buildable (no model fork); DH-64 is dataset maintenance (E18d). The four `hd1` cross-run
open questions (war-end multiplier 1.0/0.5; naval hard-gate vs continue-roll; war-hero
bonus permanent/one-term; #156-prerequisite hard-gate-all vs default-No-plan) are **TUNING
that binds inside E3/E3b**, flagged at game-mechanics §30.x for the human — NOT new
Decision-gated rows. **★ Batch-17 nets 0 — counts UNCHANGED (User-gated 2, Designer-gated
10/9):** no item enters or leaves either sub-bucket, and no new author-before-build item is
added. TWO forks RESOLVE OUT (neither was ever a Decision-gated-bucket item): **FL-on-death
→ immediate** (an open implementation fork, now ruled — shipped code still defers; the fix
is the `electFactionLeader(snap,f)` refactor in E16) and **#153 → 3-source canonical /
build-with-confidence** (was a 1-source XS quick-win, now canonical; QW18). The three
`ted1772` open questions (#158 flat-75%-oppose vs points-based anti-peace bias; the
negative-points 0-floor vs run-continuity negatives; St. Clair home-state PA-vs-OH when an
alt-state isn't owned) are **TUNING that binds inside E1/E3/E9**, flagged at game-mechanics
§30.x — NOT new Decision-gated rows. **#158/#159 are buildable (no model fork — #158's
flat-vs-bias is a tuning dial); DH-65 is dataset maintenance (E18d).** **★★ Batch-18
(`ideo1928`) nets 0 — counts UNCHANGED (User-gated 2, Designer-gated 10/9):** no item enters
or leaves either sub-bucket, and no new author-before-build item is added (**DH-66
STRENGTHENS the existing DH-54 impeachment item to 3-thread-confirmed** — a status change on
a parking-lot item, not a new bucket entry). The confirmation auto-pass is a **Ted RULING**
(`ideo1928#POST 213-214` — ready-to-build, NOT gated). The TWO open questions the batch
raises stay **human-gated TUNING, not blockers:** (a) the crash SEVERITY — one-shot meter
shock (trivially recovered in ~4 years) vs a persistent drag ordinary bills can't quickly
undo (binds inside E4c); (b) the mid-government start-state model — president-in-place vs
election-start vs historical-cabinet (#164, binds inside K4's `BootSheet`). Both flagged at
game-mechanics §30.9. **#160/DH-67/#162/#165/#166 are buildable (no model fork); the
confirmation auto-pass is designer-authoritative; #163/#164 fold into the existing DH-25 +
K4 boot work.** **★ Batches 19/20/21 net 0 — counts UNCHANGED (User-gated 2, Designer-gated
10/9):** no item enters or leaves either sub-bucket across these three batches. Batch 19
(`fixes2022`): #167 is a designer-authoritative procedure (ready-to-build, PPT-interim-first),
the enthusiasm freeze is a RISK ANNOTATION not a gate. Batch 20 (meta/design threads): #169 is a
designer-authoritative procedure with tuning guards, #168 is an authoring gate, `ampu2wish` is
quarantine-only. **★★ Batch 21 (`nixon1972`/`cpufull`/`trump2024`/`solo1916`):** the three
designer questions stay **human-gated TUNING within their epics, NOT new bucket entries** — (a)
**#158** which-way (HARD VETO vs points-based anti-peace bias — both meet the floor; binds inside
E3); (b) **#170** real-distinct-DNI/DHS-seat vs the DNI⇒CIA-Director supersession stopgap (binds
inside E16); (c) **#171** the exact ON→OFF boundary (keyed to §28.4/#108 realignment completion;
binds inside the #4/#108 work). #158's escalation is a PRIORITY change WITHIN the CPU/war track,
not a model fork. game-mechanics §13.2/§9.3.1.1/§4.1.w. **★ Batches 22/23/24 net 0 — counts
UNCHANGED (User-gated 2, Designer-gated 10/9):** no item enters or leaves either sub-bucket. Batch
22 (`modernday`): #172/#173 are buildable in existing epics (the #172 boot-flag-vs-derived question
is designer-gated TUNING within E16/E14c, NOT a new bucket entry). Batch 23 (`pop2012b`): #174/#175
are buildable in existing epics (the #174 `tedchange` cross-check + the #175 authored-list question
are designer/content-gated WITHIN their epics). **★★ Batch 24 (`grass1772`/`rookie1772`): #176 is
buildable in E1/E6 — its reverse-prereq question (adopt Cal's MilPrep prereq-reordering or keep the
founding military crisis) is designer-gated TUNING WITHIN the founding/meter work, NOT a new bucket
entry; the onboarding/solo-app/CPU-AI cluster (E9/K5 + DH-69) is a JUSTIFICATION raise on existing
items, not a model fork; the two minor war constraints (Planning-0-5 clamp + scripted-event win
path) are buildable in #155/#56. game-mechanics §17.4.**

#### (A) User-gated (the HUMAN must pick first)

**A HUMAN must choose the canonical model first; the build cannot pick one on its own.**
Distinct from "Roadmap decisions" below, which are tech-lead/planner calls already made.

- **★ #52 — Player-controlled SCOTUS: ALL-CPU vs PLAYER-CONTROLLABLE-WITH-
  RESTRICTIONS vs TRAIT-GATED (DECISION-GATED).** `dem1820` runs a **LIVE player-
  controlled court** (votes by-ideology-chart, but **delay/dismiss is a player action**;
  dismiss only Gov-Action cases; must hear ≥1 per term) — which **RE-ENABLES the
  control `pop` POST 479-480 said vcczar DISABLED** mid-design. So the three live
  models are: (a) **all-CPU-by-ideology** (the shipped intent per `pop`), (b)
  **player-controllable-with-restrictions** (the `dem1820` live model), (c)
  **trait-gated** control (Iron-Fist/Manipulative compel only). **A human must pick.**
  **★ BUT THE SCOTUS DOCKET DATA STRUCTURE IS NEEDED EITHER WAY** — regardless of who
  drives the votes, the per-term case docket must exist: it lives in
  `src/data/scotusCases<Era>.ts` + a `GameState.scotusDocket` ledger (the shipped court
  is a COIN-FLIP — `phaseRunners.ts:3397,3648` — with no docket and no player surface).
  **So E25 (the SCOTUS docket, → Phase-2 #25) is NOT blocked by this fork — build the
  docket; the player-vs-CPU surface is what waits on the pick.** Verified shipped:
  `phaseRunners.ts:3397,3648` (coin-flip), no docket. — #52 (`dem1820` delay/dismiss-
  only live court vs `pop` POST 479-480 disabled; docket → **E25**).
- **~~★ #18 — Meter→election STATE SCOPE~~ ✅ RESOLVED batch-15 — REMOVED from
  Decision-gated → PROMOTED to ready-to-build row E20b.** `terror2000` POST 913-926
  SETTLES the fork to **V's CANONICAL 2-LAYER model** (Ted, the DESIGNER, reversed his
  own "every state" reading to V's 2022 intent): **Layer 1** = a universal flat
  per-ideology meter modifier on ALL candidates of that ideology, both parties, every
  state, primary + general (the "every-state-unless-penalized" reading); **Layer 2** =
  per-ideology ENTHUSIASM as a separate per-party layer on top. This is now the **E20b**
  ready-to-build row (binds at `calcStateVote` `phaseRunners.ts:3709-3711`; composes
  with E23 + QW3). **History kept below for the record; the fork no longer gates a
  build.** Batch 10 had this as the 3-way **#18/#51** fork; the `arkzag` continuation
  **RESOLVED the #51 enthusiasm-SHIFT step** (the 4-step rule, verbatim `drums`, NOT Ted's "every state"
  nor Matt's "primaries only" — now **E23, `ready`**) and **un-gated the ±3 cap**
  (ships with E6). So what REMAINS is purely the **STATE-APPLICATION step of the
  meter→election map**: does a per-ideology-card bonus apply to **every state unless that
  state penalizes the ideology** (Ted's reading) or only to **ideology-leaning states**
  (V's)? The `arkzag` model expresses the shifts per ideology card and leaves the
  state-application to the meter→election map (#18) — so this is the last open piece. **A
  human must pick.** Verified shipped: `calcStateVote` (`phaseRunners.ts:3685`, score
  `:3709-3711`) applies enthusiasm **UNIFORMLY with no per-state penalty** today.
  **Folds into E20/E23 (election math / enthusiasm engine) once chosen** — and does NOT
  block the E23 enthusiasm-SHIFT engine, which is `ready`. — #18 (`arkzag` resolves the
  #51 half → E23; `dem1820` POST 569/575/618 + `arkzag` ch15 POST 1230 state-scope fork;
  shipped `phaseRunners.ts:3685,:3709-3711`).
- **★ NEW (batch 11) — Convention DELEGATE-CLASS assignment: AI-ALLOCATOR-BY-EV-FORMULA
  vs PLAYER-RIGGED (DECISION-GATED).** `arkzag` exposes a GA-vs-designer fork: **Zagnut
  moved delegate-class assignment to AI-AUTO** (a published 5-category EV×1..×4 formula,
  "eliminates self-dealing + saves time", ch3 POST 276), but **Ted holds delegate-
  RIGGING is INTENDED design** — and the **1840 convention REVERTED to human-set
  classes** (ch32 POST 2466). So the two live models are: (a) an **AI/deterministic
  delegate allocator** (the EV×category formula, no player input), or (b) a
  **player-set/rigged allocator** (rigging as a feature). **A human must pick which is
  canonical** before the **delegate-apportionment sub-PR of E10** (the CPU delegate
  engine) and before **E24's primary-group apportionment** consume it — but it does
  **NOT block the rest of E10** (the ballot loop / inter-ballot library / platform/VP
  sub-PRs proceed; only the apportionment sub-PR waits). Pairs with #13/#71/#104
  (the lone-ideology delegate-sweep handling). — #13 delegate-class fork (`arkzag` ch3
  POST 276 AI-auto vs ch32 POST 2466 human-set; → E10 delegate sub-PR + E24).

#### (B) Designer-gated (Ted/vcczar must close — NEW batch-12)

**10 logical items Ted floated but did NOT close — 9 OPEN bullets remain after the
batch-15 −2 recount** (the #124-percentages gate, bullets B8 + B9, CLOSED via the live
3-state tuning; per game-mechanics §30.2).
Each is a LIVE design hole — distinct from user-gated items in that the rules are
authoritative-but-incomplete (Ted started the work, didn't finish). **The roadmap-
planner should NOT schedule these as ready-to-build until Ted/vcczar closes them in
`tedchange`/`smallbugs`.** When a designer-gated item closes, it moves to a roadmap
row (often as an XS-S addition to an existing epic).

- **(B1) Mil-Prep meter level 4 fix (designer-gated open).** Ted said "I'll check what
  I did" then "wasn't better" (`tedchange#POST 290-301`). Community has three
  proposals: **30/40/30** (Umbrella + `smallbugs#POST 579`); **30/60/10** (Eric
  POST 297); **40/50/10** (Nikk POST 300). **NOT RESOLVED.** Both `tedchange` and
  `smallbugs` have the bug logged but neither closes it. → folds into **E6** (meter-
  model) when closed.
- **(B2) ★ #125 Universal Election Modifier (UEM) (designer-gated open).** Ted
  proposed (`tedchange#POST 222-241`) a single +1/-1 modifier table applied to ALL
  elections (primary + general, all offices, all eras), with ~17 +1 traits and ~16
  −1 modifiers. **Community pushback on stacking + age modifiers** (Matt POST 225:
  "this is way too powerful as-is"). Ted did NOT finalize. **Major design proposal —
  the build should NOT pre-implement until finalized.** → would fold into **E20**
  (election math) + every election context when closed.
- **(B3) Crisis trait consolidation (designer-gated open).** Ted proposed merging
  Crisis Manager / Crisis Admin / Crisis Gov into a single Crisis Manager trait, or a
  2-tier Manager + Master ladder (`tedchange#POST 73, 77-87`). vcczar "will consider";
  **OPEN tending toward consolidation.** → folds into the trait union work when
  closed.
- **(B4) Term-limit Gov actions in pre-Senate era (designer-gated open).** Umbrella
  reported CPU running a term-limit Gov action in 1818 → state ran out of candidates
  (`tedchange#POST 356-367`). Two paths flagged: (a) **void Senator requirement**
  (Eric: 2.5.2 already has the conditional language); or (b) **move term-limit
  actions to Era of Federalism start** (Ark). **Ted didn't rule.** → folds into **E11**
  (governor's actions) when closed.
- **(B5) Faithless-elector mechanic rewording (designer-gated open).** Community
  agrees the current rule is "wonky" (`tedchange#POST 371-376`). **Ted didn't post a
  final wording.** Faithless-elector rule remains as-is. → corroborates DH-13 (also
  user-gated above); folds into **E26** when closed.
- **(B6) Party rename trigger — PL vs Era Evo (designer-gated open).** Matt proposed
  Party Leaders rename parties (like factions get nicknames, `tedchange#POST
  391-395`); Ark hashed in a separate thread; **Ted did not adopt.** ERA EVOs continue
  as the rename trigger (cross-ref §25.13 Whig→Conservative). → folds into **E19**
  (faction-personality / rename triggers) when closed.
- **(B7) VP-must-be-same-party-on-resignation relaxation (designer-gated open).**
  Vee01 proposed relaxation (`tedchange#POST 362`). **No follow-up.** Currently same-
  party-only is enforced. → folds into **E10b** (succession) when closed.
- **~~(B8) Cabinet enthusiasm percentages (the #124 numeric)~~ ✅ RESOLVED batch-15 —
  REMOVED from Decision-gated.** Ted's #124 rework was RULED IN CONCEPT (batch-12,
  `tedchange#POST 1-4`) with the numbers TBD; **`terror2000` POST 1280 (+ the #31 nuke
  rework) re-tuned them LIVE to a concrete 3-STATE per-faction enthusiasm channel keyed
  on wanted-lobby-POSTS — 0 wanted → "upset" (drop), 1 → "fine" (neutral), ≥2 → "happy"
  (rise), one roll per faction, ±3-capped.** Ship that const table as canonical at
  **E16's #124 sub-item** (re-tune only if Ted publishes finer numbers). **No longer a
  gate.**
- **~~(B9) Cabinet ideology weighting — Big-4 vs rest vs cabinet-level~~ ✅ RESOLVED
  batch-15 — REMOVED from Decision-gated (same #124-numeric gate as B8).** The live
  3-state tuning (`terror2000` POST 1280) resolves the weighting question alongside the
  percentages — the same E16 const table. → ships with **E16's #124 sub-item**. **No
  longer a gate.** *(B8 + B9 are one logical gate — the #124 numeric — counted as the
  single "−1 designer-gated" in the batch-15 −2 recount.)*
- **(B10) ★ OC-4 — CPU draft ideology-distance gate (designer-gated open — NEW batch-13).**
  The all-CPU 1788 run had **both left-of-center factions headhunt Andrew Jackson (RW Pop)**
  via the draft's 25% "go for the best off-ideology pol meeting the rolled goal" branch
  (`oopscpu#POST 227-228, 234-237`) — producing incoherent rosters AND trapping the strong
  pol (an off-ideology draftee can never become faction leader → can't run for President).
  Three live paths: (a) gate off-ideology draft like 2.1.6 (pliable + same/adjacent,
  Zagnut); (b) scrap draft restrictions wholesale (Kevin); (c) an existing per-era
  faction-switch option (Sauc/ebrk). **Ted wants "a better third way" — neither
  draft-strong-pol-off-ideology-but-can-never-lead nor strong-pol-uncontested-last-pick.
  OPEN — do NOT silently ship a hard gate.** → folds into **E1 / the draft pipeline + #72
  (candidate selection)** when closed. (The #146e 9th/10th-draft-bonus-to-first-PICK ruling
  IS closed and ships with E1; only the ideology-gate is gated.) — OC-4 (`oopscpu#POST 226-228,
  234-237, 252`).
- **(B11) ★ OC-8 — "What is an office?" definition + Scandalous-Non-Office-Holder event
  rewrite (designer-gated open — NEW batch-13).** The "Scandalous Non Office Holder" Anytime
  Evo's text says "force them out of office" yet it TARGETS a non-office-holder (text
  copy-pasted from "Scandalous Office Holder"). Ted flagged `@vcczar` (`oopscpu#POST 334, 336`):
  "We need to define what is and is not an office. **Is career track an office? Is faction
  leader and/or party leader (if they don't have another position) an office?**" — a request
  for a ruling, NOT a ruling. Affects every event keyed on "office"/"non-office" status
  (#140 AnytimeEvo target pools). **OPEN — needs a vcczar author call** (an is-an-office
  predicate + the event-text rewrite). It is the **events-side twin of OC-1** (OC-1 = the CPU
  recycles a scandal-resignee; OC-8 = the event can't even tell whether someone holds an
  office). → folds into **Phase-1 #19 / E9 handler 9g (AnytimeEvo target-pool spec, #140)** +
  the event-text rewrite when closed. — OC-8 (`oopscpu#POST 334, 336`).

### Roadmap decisions (a planner CALL, not an author task)

- **★ DH-34 — Static era-biases vs. policy-reactive biases → the Red-unwinnable
  "AMPU 2.0" hole (NEW, batch 7). DECISION: ship static biases.** The single
  most-repeated `rep1800` complaint: `State.bias` is a static per-era table that
  does **not** react to policy (abolish slavery → the South should swing Red, but
  doesn't), so the Federalists are acknowledged-**unwinnable 1800–1840** (Blue
  142-0 House by 1804; Jefferson 179-0 / 197-15) and players quit. The GM +
  designer's own stance: dynamic/policy-reactive biases are *"too complicated /
  not part of the AMPU vision… maybe AMPU 2.0."* **The planner must DECIDE: ship
  static (accept the imbalance — the cheap path the forum itself chose) vs. invest
  in policy-reactive biases (a large new system).** **Tech-lead's call, adopted
  here: SHIP STATIC for now** (it is the forum's own stance and the imbalance is a
  known-accepted property); revisit only if balance becomes a release blocker.
  **This means K4's per-era state-bias table swaps in wholesale at the boundary
  (#68 step 6) but does NOT react to policy.** Pairs with #21/#34 (bias as a
  field) + DH-29's solo-balance theme. — DH-34 (`rep1800` §A 22, 350, 720-747,
  1328-1335, 2444-2457, 2641, 2711-2713). **NOT an author-before-build item — it
  is resolved (ship static); no rules to write.**

### Balance dials (fold into the named subsystem; no standalone build)

- **DH-4** — cap "Extend Credit to all nations" → **E12** (diplomacy library).
- **DH-11** — apparent Dem 3rd-party bias → **E26**; inelastic lobby cards →
  **E19** (card algorithm).
- **DH-16** — reapportionment cap 435 likely never triggers in normal play
  (POST 5352: ~year 2000 before the cap binds). No fix needed; flag for the
  apportionment recompute (E28). — batch 5.
- **DH-26 — 3rd-party VP "same traits" rule is prohibitive (NEW, batch 6).**
  An independent presidential run requires *"a VP with the same traits"* as
  the presidential candidate (Lars `pop` POST 945-947), making 3rd-party
  tickets **nearly impossible** in practice. **Pairs with DH-11** (Dem
  3rd-party structural bias). Both 3rd-party design holes are addressed
  simultaneously inside **E26** (third-party trigger): relax the trait
  constraint AND fix the structural bias. → **E26**.
- **DH-28 — "Repeal climate crisis" tag completeness is gameable (NEW,
  batch 6).** Only some Repeal bills carry the "deals with climate crisis"
  tag (`pop` POST 552); players gamed this — bills that should affect
  Planet Health but aren't tagged slip through scoring. **Per-bill
  meter-impact tags must be complete and verified at dataset-build time**;
  generalizes to other meter-impact tags. Folds into the **existing
  dataset-regeneration scripts** at `scripts/legislatorsToDataset.mjs` (or
  a sibling validator) — a CI/dataset-time validator at the existing
  pipeline. Not a standalone build item. → **dataset pipeline (§7)**.
- (DH-3 / DH-5 / #85 were cheap enough to promote to quick-wins QW5/QW6/QW7;
  DH-24 / DH-27 promoted to QW8/QW9 batch 6; **DH-30 promoted to QW10 batch 7**.
  DH-31 → E2 [bill-typing]; DH-32 → E25 [SCOTUS docket]; DH-35 → E11/E13/E24
  [era-gate the action libraries]; DH-33 → author-before-build [E29]; DH-34 →
  roadmap-decision [ship static].)

### Deferred / parking lot

- **Multiplayer — hot-seat (M1).** Round-robin the existing `needsPlayerInput`
  mechanism (`engine.ts:9`) across human factions before `advancePhase`.
  **Hard-blocked on K0 (determinism) AND on K2 + all six action libraries AND
  on K5 + the CPU handler suite** — the player-input modalities *are* the
  action libraries, and any CPU faction in the rotation uses the K5 handlers.
  **`drums` (all-CPU) confirms solo + multiplayer are two modes of one
  engine**: the K5 handlers serve both cases identically — a human taking over
  a CPU faction mid-campaign just disables the handler for that faction
  (§9.5). Also needs the singleton refactor: `playerFactionId` →
  `playerFactionIds: string[]` + audit every "is this me?" call site (debt
  #10). — gap #1, §9.5.
- **Multiplayer — async / backend (M2, L–XL epic).** IndexedDB is per-browser
  (`db.ts`); shared state needs a server (or CRDT/host-authoritative sync).
  Hard-blocked on K0 + M1. Exposes debt #6 (whole-snapshot clone+save
  bottleneck). — gap #1, §9.5.
- **Politician-to-politician trading (DH-37, NEW batch 8 — the #1 AMPU-2
  wishlist item).** A trade window between factions to swap politicians. A
  genuine small feature, but **not on any critical path** — it pairs with the
  era-boundary faction-trade window (mechanics §27.2 step 1, which DOES exist in
  spec) and with multiplayer. Park it. — DH-37 (`new1772`; **batch-20 `ampu2wish`
  CORROBORATES — re-confirmed as "the #1 AMPU-2 wishlist item," POST 60-61**).
- **★★ AMPU-2 / OUT-OF-SCOPE quarantine (NOT roadmap items for AMPU 1 — extended
  batch 20 from `ampu2wish`).** This is the explicit "for next time" / AMPU-2
  brainstorm bucket. **The roadmap MUST NOT schedule ANY of these for AMPU 1**
  (OrangeP47: "unlikely to make it into AMPU 1"; vcczar's authoritative AMPU-2
  thesis, `ampu2wish#POST 10`: the MAIN AMPU-2 change = a **day-by-day Paradox-style
  timeline**, plus a full House, a federal judiciary — *with AMPU 1 finished first*).
  Quarantined AMPU-2 ideas: **day-by-day Paradox-style timeline rebuild; a full
  per-district House (+30k pols); dynamic regions / dynamic eras; dynamic / policy-
  reactive state biases; more states; achievements; scouting / hidden-stats.** Two
  of these are ALREADY-LOGGED AMPU-2 gaps, corroborated NOT re-logged: **DH-37**
  (pol-to-pol trading, above) and **DH-34** (dynamic/policy-reactive biases — see
  the "Roadmap decisions" §; ship-static stands, a deliberate history-sim choice,
  not a bug). The full per-district House is the same parking-lot "AMPU 2.0" alt
  already noted on E28 (the build ships the focus-Rep abstraction, not +30k pols);
  a post-Gilded/post-modern "future era" remains the batch-8 NEGATIVE result (no
  source, do NOT scope). **Quarantine only — batch 20 adds ZERO buildable AMPU-1
  scope from `ampu2wish`.** — `ampu2wish` (`888ba777`); game-mechanics §30.11.5.
- **All-human Convention deadlock handling (DH-39, NEW batch 8 — multiplayer
  convention machinery).** With every faction human-controlled, the Convention
  can deadlock with no CPU compromise/dark-horse path to break it (`new1772`).
  The CPU side of convention deadlock is owned by E9 handler 9e (auto-drop-out +
  dark-horse, DH-8/DH-17); the **all-human** case needs an explicit
  deadlock-resolution rule that only matters once multiplayer (M1) lands — so it
  rides the convention epic (E10) + multiplayer. Park until M1. — DH-39
  (`new1772`).
- **Bill-scoring Phase B (divergence #1).** Re-tune `cardVoteBias`
  (`phaseRunners.ts:1516`) per-card-aware once the E20 leaderboard is live
  and playtested. — divergence #1.
- **Conversion-targeting refactor (divergence #3).** **Keep shipped for
  now.** Revisit after E19 emits a rule-driven `Can Party Flip` signal
  cleanly. (Listed as Phase-1 #21 in §9.6 "if pursued"; bundle DH-5's
  pairing-dissolution here if QW6 is deferred.) **`drums` #76 supplies the
  full 2-layer Disgruntled-auto-flip + active-poach %-table + adjacency
  gating + failure-strip — which becomes the K5 handler 9f spec when the
  refactor is approached.** — divergence #3, debt #13.
- **Named-ordinal meter relabel (presentation half).** The full labeled-
  ordinal meter *presentation* (vs the ±3 clamp in QW3 + crisis/cascade in
  E6) touches every meter read/write + the UI; ride it on the presentation
  track only if playtest says the numbers read poorly. The first-class
  war-score meter rides E3. — §21.8/§22.1.
- **Far-future / progressive era (post-1892, pre-modern).** Feminists /
  socialists / communists / prohibitionists / eugenicists / labor activists;
  movement/coalition spawning across eras (#6). The `progressive` enum
  value is added in K4; a `progressive` scenario lifts in once a
  progressive digest lands. **★ This is the FURTHEST the corpus documents — there
  is NO "Era of the Future" beyond it (batch-8 NEGATIVE RESULT).** No ingested
  thread reaches a post-Gilded/post-modern era (`tea1772`, titled "…to future,"
  stalls at 1874 mid-Gilded), so a future era has **no source and no build
  target**; **do NOT scope one**. K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`. — gap
  #2, #6; batch-8 negative result (`tea1772`).
- **Gilded-Age issue *system* depth.** Per-issue interest groups, full
  era-event spines, imperialism annexation flow distinct from `admitState`
  — beyond the E22 data shells. — gap #3, #6.
- **Cabinet "free pick-up" legislation (12b) + foreign-volunteer scheduling
  (#46).** The 1772 Treasurer free-pickup variant; events scheduling a
  future-draftable figure (Lafayette 1784) routed to the lowest-scoring
  eligible faction. (The general Executive-Branch-Interference form is E29;
  Free Executive proposals from SecTreas/SecWar are wired into E14's bill
  pipeline.) — gap #12b, #46.

removes the K5 soft-dep for solo); DH-29 is REFRAMED from CPU-only to a STRUCTURAL

bounded by 1772-RevWar-winnable); #157 → E3b (a) (CSA-government seeding, S); DH-64 →
E18d (`Southern Unionist` dataset audit, XS). NO re-sequence, NO new keystone, NO new
author-before-build or Decision-gated items (batch 16 nets 0).** **Batch 17 (`ted1772`) is
FOUNDING-ERA CONFIDENCE + TWO NEW FOUNDING SUBSYSTEMS — the 4th captured 1772 source and
the 3rd CPU-heavy source. It PROMOTES #153 to build-with-confidence (3-source canonical +
the St. Clair emergent-President LIVE demo; the ×2-Command-gain knob is the load-bearing
unbuilt half, keystone-free; QW18 confidence raised), EXTENDS E1 with #159 (the
Constitutional-Convention subsystem, M–L, extending the shipped `constitutionalConvention.ts`,
leading with the slave-compromise→EV-penalty plank + the per-article eliminate-revote
loop), COUPLES #158 with #155/E3 (build together — #158 is one of the three RevWar floors)
and PINS the three RevWar winnability floors as a HARD constraint on the #155 war-balance
pass (floor 1 SHIPPED, floors 2+3 BUILD, 1772 must stay winnable), slots FL-on-death (S
standalone fix → factor `electFactionLeader`, in E16) + DH-65 (XS → E18d / #120 umbrella;
the Cosmopolitan⊕Provincial trait-exclusivity half is already engine-shipped), and appends
`ted1772` corroboration tags to #56/#133/#70/#72/#74/#76/DH-61/#86/#136. NO re-sequence,
NO new keystone, NO new author-before-build or Decision-gated items (batch 17 nets 0; TWO

author-before-build or decision-gated items.** **Batch 15 (`terror2000`) is
MODERN-ENGINE MID-TIER WINS — it PROMOTES one Decision-gated fork (#18 → E20b), adds one
small end-condition module (#88 → E6), extends two epics (#152 → E3, #124+#151 → E16's
3rd re-scope), slots #153 (QW18) + #154 (E16), and recounts Decision-gated −2; NO
re-sequence, NO new keystone, NO new author-before-build items.** **Batch 18 (`ideo1928`)
is THE ECONOMIC ENGINE'S SECOND ERA — the FIRST 1928-start interwar campaign. #160 EXTENDS
E4c (the `arkzag` Bank-War work) with the interwar layer — Great-Depression META-event +
EconStab→industry cascade (2 industries −1/state → EV-reflow) + crisis-gated New-Deal bills
(`Bill.requiresCrisis`) — so E4c is now WELL-SPECIFIED ACROSS TWO ERAS: build it GENERIC,
add interwar content as DATA; couples E2 + E6; M as an E4c extension. DH-67 (event-gate the
era's BLUE party bias to the crash firing, at the `partyPref*5` term in `calcStateVote`) is
the CENTRAL #160 takeaway and the highest-value single fix in the batch — S, build it WITH
#160 (it is the switch that makes the meta-event load-bearing). The confirmation AUTO-PASS
gate folds into E16 / E9-handler-9d (S, Ted-authoritative `ideo1928#POST 213-214`; auto-
confirm EXCEPT {State/Treasury/AG/Defense}/Controversial/<3-skill — fixes the §25.5 36%-pass
pathology by keeping most picks off the vote). #161 makes the era band 6-START-CONFIRMED
(K3/K4 confidence, no scope). #162 EXTENDS E12 with the era-keyed 7-nation interwar roster
(no Israel yet); the #56-negative (ideology framing ≠ war trigger) is a scoping note. DH-66
STRENGTHENS the existing DH-54 impeachment author-before-build item to 3-thread-confirmed
(DH-33/DH-54/DH-66, await Ted's pending rewrite). #165 → DH-53 shared structured-effect-
tables fix; #166 → the economic-engine/industry-scoring work; #163/#164 → BOOT (DH-25
career-track family + the K4 `BootSheet` start-state field). NO re-sequence, NO new keystone,
NO new author-before-build or Decision-gated items (batch 18 nets 0).** **Batch 19 (`fixes2022`)
is THE EARLIEST DISCUSSION SOURCE — PROVENANCE + ONE NEW SUBSYSTEM. #167 no-eligible-successor
constitutional-crisis FOLDS INTO E10b as the no-successor member of one E10b crisis family
(reuses #62's 1-vote-per-state delegation machinery — build #62 once, reuse for both; ship the
PPT-as-acting-President interim default FIRST [S], then the full House-election procedure [M];
couples #61/#88/DH-54). Enthusiasm (#18/#51/#124) is FLAGGED as the perennial-fork RISK on E23
+ E20b — freeze the #51/#18 model as a FROZEN SPEC (the single likeliest drift point;
`fixes2022#POST 713-716`). `fixes2022` is the EARLIEST source for #153/#135/#124/#121/#88 →
build-confidence where they sit (no resize/move). The era-event firing-rate budget (~70%/era)
is a small addition to E15 (S); the `fixes2022` dataset batch folds into #120/E18d. NO

ESCALATION + TWO era-keyed gaps [one PARTLY SHIPPED] + ONE DH bug: **★★ #158 CPU anti-game-over
is RE-PRIORITIZED HIGHER WITHIN the CPU/war track** — `cpufull` is the 2nd live CPU game-over and
FIELD-FALSIFIES the flat-75% patch (a game-ending peace passed at a 4-5-4 PLURALITY after the
CC-President's reject was overridden), so the floor-(3) fix in E3 is re-scoped to a HARD VETO /
points-based anti-peace bias + a NON-plurality-overridable game-ending-peace; it is a SOLO-PLAY
BLOCKER (the "DH-29 of the CPU/war track"), makes #155 RevWar floor #3 LEAKY, builds WITH #155
(E3) + #75 (E9) AHEAD of the rest of the CPU/war track, and bears on #114 (debt #32 escalated +
#34a). **#170 era-keyed offices** → EXTENDS E16 (founding-seat half LIVE in `cabinetSeatsForYear`;
add modern departments to `OfficeType` + a `foundedYear`/`createdByBill`/`supersedes` table + the
DNI⇒CIA-Director supersession on the planned boot-seed cabinet-seat refactor), S–M (debt #47).
**#171 era-keyed draft-ideology TOGGLE** (OFF in the modern present, Ted-authoritative; 1916 ON /
1972 ON / 2024 OFF) → FOLDS INTO the #4/#108 draft-profile work as an era-keyed boolean, S (debt
#48). **DH-68** (Czechoslovakia/Hungary fired before WWI ended) → FOLDS INTO the DH-60 era-event-
precondition work (now multi-era) — port the 1772-graph `precondition` layer into the
calendar-only 1856 builder + a new Progressive builder, S (debt #49). CORROBORATIONS (no moves):

So **#169 folds into E15** (the elderly-pres drop-out → endorse-VP event, S, DISTINCT from #37,
Era-of-Populism-scoped); **#168 is recorded as a pre-build authoring-quality pass** (NOT a

per-era content authoring; **`biden2021` folds into the modern content tail** (E30 / §28.13);
**`dbomit` folds into #120**; and **`ampu2wish` is quarantined OUT OF SCOPE** — all additive,

So **#167 folds into E10b** (one crisis family, reuses #62, PPT-interim-first); **the enthusiasm

This is the **most-corroborated era in the KB now** (4 threads: `new1772` MP / `tea1772`
solo-all-CPU / `85f8e6b4` solo-aesthetic / `ted1772` mostly-CPU, plus `oopscpu` all-CPU
1788) — but it is **CONFIDENCE, not new keystones or a re-sequence.** #159 lives inside E1
(which already carries the DH-61 + DH-62 prerequisites and sits behind K4/`scenarioBoot`);
it EXTENDS the shipped `constitutionalConvention.ts` (like the 1856 CW engine extends
`scenario1856`, not a new scenario) and stays downstream of the keystones. #158 builds
inside E3 alongside #155 as RevWar floor (3). #153 is a confidence promotion of an
existing XS–S quick-win (QW18), not a new row. **Three OPEN QUESTIONS the digest raises
stay human-gated (tuning, not blockers):** (a) #158 — flat 75%-oppose vs points-based
anti-peace bias (pick one); (b) the negative-points floor — V's 0-floor vs Ted's
run-continuity negatives (likely 0); (c) St. Clair's home-state PA-vs-OH when an alt-state
isn't owned yet (pairs with #92's territory gate). All bind inside E1/E3/E9 and are
flagged at game-mechanics §30.x. **Decision-gated / parking-lot counts are UNCHANGED
(batch 17 nets 0):** no item enters or leaves the user/designer Decision-gated bucket, and
no new author-before-build item is added — TWO forks RESOLVE OUT (both were open, not

This is the **highest-value Reconstruction work in the backlog** — but it is **NOT a
keystone and does NOT re-sequence anything.** #156 lives inside E3b (which already sits
right after E3 + K2, §9.1.2); its arrival makes E3b's readmission half **less risky**
(its hardest open question — how Reconstruction ever resolves solo — is now answered by
the unilateral-adopt prerequisite) and **removes the soft-dependency on E9 handler #2
for the solo case**, but E3b stays downstream of the keystones (K0/K2/K3/K4) exactly as
before. **The four cross-run open questions** (war-end multiplier 1.0/0.5; naval
hard-gate vs continue-roll; war-hero bonus permanent/one-term; whether #156's
prerequisite hard-gates ALL readmission or permits a default No-plan) are **tuning, not
blockers** — they bind inside E3/E3b and are flagged at game-mechanics §30.x for the
human. **Decision-gated / parking-lot counts are UNCHANGED:** no item enters or leaves
the user/designer Decision-gated bucket, and no new author-before-build item is added —
**DH-29 was a debt item, now with a designed fix (#156); #156/#155/#157 are buildable;
DH-64 is dataset maintenance.**

**#153 → QW18** (the ×2 Command-gain multiplier); **#154 → E16** (the 4-step elected-seat

**★★★ Batch-13 lead A — `oopscpu` DOES NOT change the K5/E9 ORDER; it DE-RISKS E9.
Reflect it by folding OC-* into handler rows + bumping build-confidence, NOT by
re-sequencing** (tech-lead §9 batch-13 lead + §6.6.1 batch-13 — BINDING):
> "`oopscpu` is the first batch that systematically validates a whole subsystem's spec

folded in), build-confidence bumped on the 6 validated handlers, 9e flagged as the one
still needing validation — **no re-order, no new handlers.**

> DEATH case — the acting state is retained ONLY for the incapacity branch. It folds into

So **#143 lands as QW17** (the XS quick-win cluster) and **the #61 death-branch re-scopes
E10b** (S) with the reconciled death = full-President spec; acting/divert kept for incapacity.

**★★ Batch-13 lead C — DH-61 (S) + DH-62 (M) are `scenario1788` (E1) PREREQUISITES —
sequence WITH E1** (tech-lead §9 batch-13 lead #6 — BINDING):
> "Neither is optional for a 1788 boot. **DH-61 (S):** scenario-boot must seed era-active
> wars (they forgot the Northwest Indian War) → a `BootSheet.activeWars` field + a boot hook
> over the generic `War` model; folds into the scenario-boot pipeline (Phase-1 #3 / K4
> BootSheet). **DH-62 (M):** the pre-12A two-vote/no-ticket EC mode + same-state-EV → an
> era-keyed election-mode variant in the per-state-EC epic (Phase-1 #4 / E4). `scenario1788`
> (E1) is near the front of the queue, so these two must land WITH it — make the dependency
> explicit on the E1 row."

So **DH-61 is wired into K4 / the boot pipeline, DH-62 into E4 (per-state EC), and BOTH are
explicit deps on the E1 row** — a 1788 boot cannot run (no active wars seeded; no pre-12A
election mode) without them.

**★★ Batch-13 lead D — OC-4 + OC-8 → designer-gated sub-bucket (9 → 11)** (tech-lead §9
batch-13 lead #4 — BINDING):
> "OC-4 (off-ideology CPU draft gate — Ted wants 'a better third way' than
> draft-strong-pol-off-ideology vs. uncontested; do NOT silently ship a hard gate;
> `oopscpu#POST 227-228, 234`) and OC-8 (define 'office' for the Scandalous-Non-Office-Holder
> forced-out event + rewrite the event text; flagged to `@vcczar`, `oopscpu#POST 334, 336`)
> are OPEN design calls — add both to the designer-gated parking sub-bucket alongside the 9
> open `tedchange` items. NOT ready-to-build until Ted/vcczar closes them."

So **Decision-gated counts: User-gated 3 (unchanged) + Designer-gated 11** (9 batch-12 + OC-4 +
OC-8). The all-CPU run also **resolves #52 for the all-CPU case** (CPU SCOTUS by
ideology-distance) — the player-vs-CPU surface stays user-gated; **#18 state-scope RECURS
unresolved** (`oopscpu#POST 205-214`) and stays user-gated.

**★★ Batch-13 lead E — the ALL-CPU-TEST is a repeatable SPEC-VALIDATION methodology
(recommend it; NOT a build row)** (tech-lead §9 batch-13 lead #5 / §9.1.3 — BINDING):
> "Adopt the all-CPU test as a repeatable spec-validation tool. `oopscpu` validated SIX
> handlers (#70/#72/#73/#74/#75/#76) BEFORE they're built, surfaced 8 concrete sub-gaps
> (OC-1…OC-8), and — because an all-CPU game needs no human players — is **immune to the
> GM-burnout (DH-36)** that killed two playtests. It is cheap, repeatable, and the highest-ROI
> validation method for the CPU surface. **Recommend a POST-12A all-CPU run before building

> handler `oopscpu` could not exercise; a post-12A all-CPU run would validate it exactly as
> `oopscpu` validated the other six. Record this as a methodology note, not a build row."

So this is a **methodology note, NOT a roadmap row**: run an all-CPU test to validate a CPU
subsystem's spec before building it, and specifically run a **post-12A all-CPU game to validate
handler 9e (convention)** before that handler is built. It reinforces (does not replace) the
upkeep-automation rationale (DH-36, below) — automation + spec-validation-without-humans both
reduce the manual burden that kills playtests.

**★★★★★ Batch-12 lead A — QW0 / BUG-0 FULLY CLOSES; promote it to top-of-queue
with const=4 + alt-state EXEMPTION guard** (tech-lead §9 batch-12 lead #1 — BINDING):
> "`smallbugs#POST 734-735` (vcczar-12-30-25 'Approved by vczar') settled the cap:
> 'A faction is limited to FOUR total attempted moves per half-term. A politician
> that moves to an ALT-STATE does NOT count against the FOUR total moves.' This
> closes the long-running BUG-0 / QW0 / batch-10 top-of-queue item from 'open-

> `runPhase_2_1_4_Relocations`). **This is now the cheapest + safest win in the

> value AND the exemption are both authoritative."

So **QW0 is the new top of the queue** (it was previously the top, but the cap
value was open; now it's settled + the alt-state exemption is authoritative). The
top-of-queue order is now **QW0 → K0/K2 → K3/K4 + `scenarioBoot`/`BootSheet` →
scenario1788 (E1) …**.

**★★★★★ Batch-12 lead B — Cabinet → enthusiasm REWORK (#124) is the M-sized
teardown; LAND AFTER K2 + K5; build it WITH the confirmation system from day one**
(tech-lead §9 batch-12 lead #2 — BINDING):
> "Ted's `tedchange#POST 1-4` re-architects the lobby→enthusiasm path that was
> already on the roadmap as DH-23 / E16 cabinet confirmation. (a) LOBBY satisfaction

> **Size: M (was XS-S).** The numeric percentages stay designer-gated until Ted

So **E16 is RE-SCOPED M (was L with a XS-S confirmation step inside)** — confirmation
+ #124 rework BUILD TOGETHER from day one; lands AFTER K2 + K5; **the numeric
percentages stay designer-gated in the new "designer-gated" sub-bucket items (8) +
(9) of the parking lot**.

**★★ Batch-12 lead C — the OTHER 18 Ted-rulings: 12 XS + 5 S + 3 M; sized + slotted
into existing epics** (tech-lead §9 batch-12 lead #3 — BINDING):
> "**12 XS:** #135 50/50 House inverse-control (one-line at `phaseRunners.ts:1864`)

> DH-51 / DH-28)."

So the **18 rulings slot into existing epics — no new epics, no re-sequence.** Each
row is tagged with its `tedchange#POST N` for traceability.

**★★ Batch-12 lead D — BUILD-TARGET SIMPLIFICATION on E5 + E25: amendments NOT
SCOTUS-challengeable; #100 overridden** (tech-lead §9 batch-12 lead #4 — BINDING):
> "Ted/vcczar's `smallbugs#POST 250-269` ruling: Govs CANNOT challenge amendments
> via SCOTUS — the Constitution is by-definition constitutional. This OVERRIDES
> `tea1772`'s #100 ruling ('SCOTUS can overturn an amendment via Gov-requested

> E5 retains the strike-a-statute path + the mutable-threshold field; E25 retains
> the docket + Justice drift + court size + DH-32 state-guard. This is a sequencing
> simplification, not a new item."

So **E5 + E25 are simplified** by the drop. **#100's review-of-amendment half is
superseded; the threshold half (3/4 → 2/3) is retained** (already implied by #64).

**★★ Batch-12 lead E — DECISION-GATED SPLIT: user-gated (3 carried) vs designer-
gated (9 NEW)** (tech-lead §9 batch-12 lead #5 — BINDING):
> "Batch 12 makes the authority hierarchy explicit — **Ted/vcczar > GA > inference**

> ready-to-build until Ted/vcczar closes them in `tedchange`/`smallbugs`."

So **Decision-gated category counts: User-gated 3 + Designer-gated 9.** **The
user-gated set is the batch-11 carry** (#52 + #18 + delegate-class); **the
designer-gated set is NEW this batch** (the 9 open `tedchange` items, NOT ready-
to-build).

**★ Batch-12 lead F — STRENGTHENINGS (no new rows, multi-thread corroboration)**
(tech-lead §9 batch-12 lead #6 — BINDING):
> "**#76 (CPU conversion adjacency)** EXTENDED via `tedchange` (same-party can
> target same OR adjacent ideology — folds into E5b's #127 schedule). **#99 (ideology
> = circle)** now **TED-AUTHORITATIVE** (3-thread corroboration → designer-ruled;
> 25% LW↔RW Pop rate pinned; auto-Two-Faced grant on cross-circle flip — folds

> SCOTUS review of amendments)** is OVERRIDDEN by Ted/vcczar (per lead D); mark
> superseded in the build-target."

So **no new rows for the strengthenings** — they fold inline into the existing
E5b / E6 / E5 + E25 rows, marked as designer-RULED / superseded.



**★ Batch-11 lead A — #116 economic engine = a NEW small epic `E4c`, placed AFTER
E2 + E6 + E4b(b); build it EMERGENT, not scripted** (tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead #1 —
BINDING):
> "#116 is the long-run content STATE MACHINE sitting on top of E4b(b)'s §27.6
> Second-Bank institution. It needs E2 (`Bill.type` / crisis bypass), E6 (named EconStab
> meter + crisis/cascade), and E4b(b) (the Bank it recharters/replaces). Build it
> EMERGENT — recurring CRISIS bills that resolve an EconStab CRISIS → Independent
> Treasury via a `Bill.replaces` field + a per-bill-class `lockedUntilYear` tariff
> cooldown — NOT scripted. Carry 'scripted-vs-emergent' as a design note, not a blocker.
> Verified UNBUILT: `applyEffect` (`phaseRunners.ts:3209`) only nudges 7 meters;
> `Legislation` (`types.ts:1506`) has no `type`/`replaces`/`lockedUntilYear`."

So **E4c sequences after E2 + E6 + E4b(b)** and is a SMALL epic (three additive fields
on a substrate that already exists). It is **content** sitting on the §27.6 Bank
institution — it does not move any keystone or re-order the spine.

**★ Batch-11 lead B — #119 RE-SCOPES E5, #61 RE-SCOPES E10b (do NOT open new epics)**
(tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead #2/#3 — BINDING):
> "#119 amendment lifecycle → ADD to E5: the explicit lifecycle (propose→committee→
> floor→governor-ratify→active), the active-amendment-blocks-a-legislation-class hook
> (the proactive face of E5's existing *Pollock* gate), and the un-bundleable flag (no
> `amendments` field in `GameState` today). #61 succession chain → ADD to E10b:
> VP-succeeds-on-death → fill-VP (gated on E5's VP-vacancy amendment being `active`) →
> acting-president action-divert roll + trait side-effect. The KILL TRIGGER already
> SHIPS (`anytimeEvents.ts:232` fires `{kind:'death'}`; death sets `presidentId=null`
> via `vacateOffice` `phaseRunners.ts:2449`) — so the succession ENGINE is the work; the
> line-of-succession/impeachment half stays parking-lot (DH-54)."

So **E5 + E10b are STRENGTHENED in place** — both sit in their existing Phase order
(E5 mid-Phase-1, E10b after E10). #61's VP-succeeds/acting-divert path is ready-to-build;
its line-of-succession half is the already-listed DH-54 author-before-build item.

**★ Batch-11 lead C — #51 PROMOTED (now SETTLED); only #18 + the NEW delegate-class
fork stay Decision-gated** (tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead #4/#5 — BINDING):
> "The 4-step enthusiasm-reshuffle + −100/waiver rule → E23, now `ready` (the `arkzag`
> final chunk published the 4-step rule verbatim, matching `drums`). The ±3 cap is
> UNCONDITIONALLY ready (binds at `calcStateVote` `:3709-3711`, ships with E6). Only the

> Decision-gated, leave only #18. A NEW delegate-class fork (AI-allocator-by-EV-formula
> vs player-rigged) joins Decision-gated — a pick before E10's delegate-apportionment
> sub-PR (and E24's primary apportionment), but it does NOT block the rest of E10."

So **E23 is now `ready`** (the reshuffle is no longer fork-blocked), **QW3's ±3 cap is
un-gated** (ships with E6), and **Decision-gated holds at 2** (#52 SCOTUS + the merged
#18-state-scope/delegate-class election-engine picks).

**★ Batch-11 lead D — the bug-folds + the meta-signal** (tech-lead §9 batch-11 lead
#6/#8 — BINDING):
> "DH-59 (XS) folds into E12 when the 9-point relations scale is built — no standalone
> patch (today it clamps −5..5 at `applyEffect:3223`). DH-60 (S) = the concrete face of

> deaths + 1 survived-by-scripting) that STRENGTHENS the automation-reduces-upkeep
> argument behind E9/#55/#115. Cite it; don't queue a row."

So **DH-59 → E12, DH-60 → E15+BUG-1** (no standalone rows), and the **3-thread
automation signal** is folded into the upkeep-reduction rationale (DH-36, below) rather
than queued. **#115 priority is UNCHANGED** (re-confirmed by the continuation-boot, §9.1.9)
and **no keystone moves.**

**★ Batch-10 lead A — the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` PIPELINE (#115) is PROMOTED to
the FRONT of the subsystem queue, but it FOLDS INTO K4's `BootSheet` schema — it is
NOT a new keystone** (tech-lead §9.1.9, §9 batch-10 lead #1 — BINDING):
> "#115 is the single most-requested missing item in the forum's own words — there
> are no documented rules for CREATING a game. Verified shipped-state: NO shared boot
> abstraction — `startNewGame` (`GameContext.tsx:264`) switches on a literal into

> scenario becomes a data row. This is the venue for the XS boot validators (DH-24,
> DH-27) and the appointment-ladder."

So **#115 sequences K0 → `scenarioBoot`/`BootSheet` (built with K4) → scenarios-as-
data**, and is **built with `scenario1788` (E1) before the third hand-authored copy.**
It is NOT a keystone (it folds into K4); QW8/QW9 + the #115b appointment-ladder live
inside it. No new keystone, no re-order — but the boot pipeline moves to the front of
the subsystem work because the next scenario (E1) needs it and would otherwise be a
third hand-authored copy.

**★ Batch-10 lead B — TWO forks are DECISION-GATED (a HUMAN design pick), NOT
ready-to-build** (tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #2 — BINDING):
> "Each fork has 3 live models and needs a human design pick first. Player-controlled
> SCOTUS (#52): all-CPU-by-ideology vs player-controllable-with-restrictions vs
> trait-gated — but the SCOTUS docket data structure is needed either way (→ E25); it
> lives in `src/data/scotusCases<Era>.ts` + a `GameState.scotusDocket` ledger (shipped

> uniformly with NO ±3 cap, NO per-state penalty — the cap is a queued XS clamp (QW3)
> but its binding point + state-scope wait on this fork."

So both forks are recorded under **"Decision-gated"** in the parking lot — NOT in
"Up next." **The work that does NOT wait on the picks is buildable now:** the SCOTUS
**docket** (E25, the player-vs-CPU surface is what's gated) and the **meter-write ±3
clamp** (QW3, the enthusiasm-application binding is what's gated).

**★ Batch-10 lead C — the SIZED corroborated fixes slot into existing epics**
(tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #3 — BINDING): **DH-53** bill-EV-sign = **S, author
STRUCTURED bill-effect tables** (NOT a sign-flip — `Legislation.effects` has no
per-state EV field; `applyEffect` `phaseRunners.ts:3209` can't mutate `electoralVotes`)
→ **E20** + K4's DH-48 `evDelta` shape; **DH-24** Senate-class validator = **XS into
the boot pipeline** (QW8); **focus-Rep (EV−2)/5 House (#55)** = **M into scaling-wall-
(b) (E7) + the census epic (E28)**; **statehood→sectional-crisis (#59)** = **S additive
at `admitState`** (`territories.ts:8` does no balance check; fires from 1820/Nationalism
starts too) → folds into **E3b** (b); **appointment-ladder + replacement-gains timing
(#115b)** = **XS each into boot/appointment rules** (the ladder pairs with **DH-25**).

**★ Batch-10 lead D — the era model is 4-START-CONFIRMED (confidence, not scope)**
(tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #4): `dem1820`'s own draft table prints "Era of Democracy
(1820-1840)" → "Manifest Destiny (1840-1856)" (POST 946), so the #92 content-band model
now holds across **1772 + 1800 + 1820 + 1948**. K3/K4 stay the safest large bet; no
re-spec.

**★ Batch-10 lead E — DH-36 is the PRIORITIZATION ARGUMENT for the upkeep-reducing
items, NOT a row** (tech-lead §9 batch-10 lead #5): `dem1820` is the **2nd GA-burnout
DEATH** in the KB (after `new1772`), this one driven by **player friction from
undocumented/inconsistent rules COMPOUNDED by manual upkeep** (a 10-page/8-day midterm;
constant sheet repair). "Automation reduces the manual-upkeep burden that's killing
playtests" is now corroborated across **2 dead threads**, and the friction came from
**undocumented setup rules** — which is exactly the case for **#115 (the boot pipeline
canonicalizes the disclosed ruleset), #55 (focus-Rep cuts House upkeep), E7 (House-
slate persistence), and K5/E9 (the CPU suite owns the deterministic upkeep a human GM
can't sustain).** It justifies the ORDERING (boot pipeline + upkeep-reducers near the
front), not a new item. **★ Batch-23 UPDATE — the burnout-death/stall count keeps growing: `pop2012b` is ANOTHER GM-burnout DEATH (the GA Rodja RESIGNED — "freaking hard … to be the literal computer tracking every rule," POST 938), after `new1772` + `dem1820` (deaths) and `nixon1972`/`modernday` (burnout-stalls). The automation-reduces-upkeep argument (DH-36/DH-69/#114) is now corroborated across MULTIPLE abandoned threads — strengthens the SAME ORDERING call (no new row; the in-app rules / legal-move surface DH-69 + the CPU action-picker primitive serve the same pain).**

**★ Batch-9 lead A — the era model is 3-START-CONFIRMED and gains a TWO-LEVEL
refinement + a structured-era-event-data requirement; still NOT a new keystone, NO
re-sequence** (tech-lead §9.1.5 updated, §9 batch-9 lead #1 — BINDING):
> "Two saves at two start years (batch 8) + a third start year (1948, batch 9), one
> deterministic band sequence ⇒ the era keystones (K3/K4) are the safest large bet
> in the roadmap… Both must be built; do NOT collapse them: (a) point-banked
> Historical Eras with RULE-DELTAS (the Era-of-Terror cabinet rework proves bands
> carry rule changes, not just content) AND (b) a separate per-decade census doing
> bulk EV-reallocation + state-bias re-lean + content-rotation… era-event data needs
> STRUCTURED `evDelta`/census fields (DH-48 — the Neocon census events were LOST as
> free-text). 'Neocons' is a faction-rebrand, NOT a band."

So K3 gains the census-as-a-second-schedule + the per-band rule-delta hooks; K4 gains
the structured era-event data + per-era completeness validators. Both stay **M**;
both land inside the existing keystones. No new keystone, no re-order.

**★★ Batch-9 lead B — NEGATIVE SCOPE: there is NO Cold-War subsystem; do NOT queue
one** (tech-lead §9.1.8, the single most important scope-control finding this batch
— BINDING):
> "Despite the 'Nuclear Age' title there is NO purpose-built Cold-War system — no
> containment engine, no nuclear/MAD model, no NATO/Article-5 bloc, no space-race
> subsystem, no army/navy/air branches… Grep confirms only `revolutionaryWar.ts`
> exists… Net: zero new engine subsystems for 'the Cold War.' The work is the generic
> war engine + diplomacy (both already on the roadmap) + content."

So the Nuclear-Age era is **DATA on top of E3 (generic war) + E12 (diplomacy)** — and
those two rows gain the load-bearing build-holes the label hides: **E3 must RESOLVE**
(DH-47: wars never end today; ideally army/navy/air branches), and **E12 is the real
modern foreign subsystem** (8 relation meters + ambassador actions; DH-46 downward
pressure; DH-45 USSR-collapse trigger). This mirrors the batch-8 no-future-era guard:
a negative result that prevents the biggest scope-creep risk in the modern era.

**★ Batch-9 lead C — CPU-faction AI is LOAD-BEARING (K5 + E9 elevated, NOT
re-sequenced)** (tech-lead §9.1.3 priority bump — BINDING):
> "The digital APP is built for 1-human-vs-9-CPU (multiplayer 'goes off the rails';
> the points system is for the CPUs, not humans)… the app is a solo adaptation of a
> multiplayer game, so the entire multiplayer apparatus must be CPU-AI-driven… This
> does NOT re-sequence K5 (it still lands after K0 + K2), but it raises K5 + the

So K5's **placement is unchanged** (after K0+K2, parallel with K3/K4); its
**priority/status rises** — the E9 handler suite is now a first-class Phase-1 system,
not a nice-to-have. The `nuke` thread also confirms the whole MP-apparatus surface was
**entirely UNEXERCISED** by the human playtest, so it must be authored from spec.

**Batch-9 small placements (no re-order):** E16 → **create-AND-abolish** cabinet
seats (`abolishesCabinetSeat?`); E25 → **legislated variable SCOTUS size +
excess-not-replaced** (#112); E10b/E29 → the modern institutional layer (#105 +
DH-54 author-before-build); E20 → realignment + landslide-cap (#108/#110/DH-52); E30
→ `scenario1948` as a 4th `BootSheet` boot + DH-51 dataset parity. **Senate
pass-threshold resolved-in-code = simple majority** (`phaseRunners.ts:3562`); the
60%/cloture design question stays OPEN for the human. **Parking lot → 12** (DH-49
population-model+House-cap, the one new infra item; DH-54 impeachment/succession).


**★ Batch-8 lead — the ERA MODEL (K3/K4) is now the HIGHEST-confidence finding in
the KB; this batch changes confidence, not structure** (tech-lead §9 batch-8 lead
/ §9.1.5 batch-8 confidence bump — NO re-sequence, NO new keystone):
> "Two independent saves emit the identical era-band sequence at identical in-game
> dates: `tea1772` (1772-start solo all-CPU) and `rep1800` (1800-start
> multiplayer), 28 in-game years apart. The bands are deterministic game-state
> content-gates, not GM flavor. **The K3/K4 spec was already condition-driven from
> batch 7 — nothing changes structurally.** This raises the era keystones to the
> **highest-confidence large bet in the roadmap**; treat the content-band model as
> settled."

So: (1) **K3/K4 are MULTI-SAVE PROVEN** — the safest large era bet; start there if
engine staffing is scarce. (2) **#102's dual era-scoring** (per-era + cumulative)
is the **WIN-CONDITION scoreboard** — it folds into K3/K4 point-banking (the win
condition is DUAL), not a new item. (3) **E16's dynamic-seat refactor is
reinforced** — `cabinetSeatsForYear` is the WRONG model at BOTH ends
(founding offices-by-law + modern bill-creates-a-seat), so it is foundational to
the offices-as-data theme, not modern-only. (4) **DH-41 is the one new
author-before-build item** (the general SCOTUS-ruling → statute cascade, deferred;
parking lot → 10 total). (5) **★ NEGATIVE RESULT — no thread reaches a "future"
era; the roadmap does NOT scope one (K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`).**
(6) **DH-36 (GM-burnout abandoned a 12-turn game) is the META justification** for
the whole build — cited in the intro, not queued. All other batch-8 deltas
(#100/#103/#104/#105 + DH-38/39/40/42/43/44) **fold into existing epics** with no
re-order; **DH-43 lands as QW11** (Vermont dataset fix).


**★ Batch-7 lead A — the ERA-MODEL REFRAME re-specs K3 + K4, it is NOT a new
keystone** (tech-lead §9.1.5 / §9.6 lead #0 / divergence #18 — the single most
important call this batch, and the biggest architectural reframe of the era
keystones across all 7 batches):
> "An 'era' in AMPU is a **content-band** — a set of available bills + era-events
> + draftees + a state-bias table — that the game advances through on **game-state
> / meter / territory-ownership triggers, evaluated per half-term**, NOT by
> matching a real calendar date… Verified: phases gate by `year % 4`/`year % 2`
> (`phases.ts:49-59`, **correct for cadence and stay**); the ONLY era advance is
> the hard-coded `currentEra = 'federalism'` at `constitutionalConvention.ts:198`;
> **there is no year→era derivation anywhere** — so this is a generalization of
> one existing trigger, not a rewrite. `advanceEra(snap)` watches an
> `era.advanceWhen` condition; content gates on `game.eraBand` + a new
> `territoryOwned` predicate, **not the calendar**. RECONCILES #68 per-era
> point-banking + §26 BootSheet boot model + §27.1 content-band finding into ONE
> era system."

So K3 changes from `advanceEra(snap, target)` to `advanceEra(snap)`; K4 gains the
per-era content-band registry `{bills, eraEvents, draftees, biasTable,
advanceWhen}`; the early sub-bands (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) are
content-band **markers**, not new enum values (tech-lead's call: markers first).
Both stay **M**. The new `territoryOwned` predicate is **one predicate, three
consumers** (bills, era-events, draft pool).

**★★ Batch-7 lead B — the RECONSTRUCTION SOLO-BLOCKER (DH-29) is a hard BUILD
REQUIREMENT on E3b** (tech-lead §9.1.6 / §9.6 lead #1 — the second-most-important
call, a hard gate on the 1856-arc shipping as a winnable solo game):
> "GM-verified (`rep1800` POST 9170): the historical Strict/Ironclad readmission
> plan can **NEVER pass with CPU factions** → **solo Reconstruction is
> UNRESOLVABLE**, which dead-ends the 1856-arc as a winnable solo scenario (and
> AMPU is single-player). **E3b's definition-of-done must include a CPU-passable
> readmission path** — my rec: (1) a CPU default-vote bias for the flagged
> historical plan (K5 handler #2) **+** (3) an era-boundary auto-resolution
> backstop (K3). The readmission half of E3b should land AFTER K5 handler #2 or
> carry the era-boundary auto-resolution as its self-contained fallback. **Ties
> E3b to the CPU handler suite (K5 / E9).**"

So E3b's readmission half (sub-PR d) is **gated on E9 handler #2 OR K3's
condition-driven `advanceEra`** — the one place the 1856-arc genuinely *needs* the
CPU handler suite, not merely benefits from it. The war half (a–c) is unblocked.

**★★ Batch-16 UPDATE to batch-7 lead B — DH-29 is REFRAMED (CPU-only → STRUCTURAL)
and gets its DESIGNED FIX (#156); the SOLO soft-dependency on E9 handler #2 is
REMOVED** (tech-lead §9 batch-16 lead + §9.1.12 — BINDING):
> "`hd1` played the Civil-War→Reconstruction arc with HUMANS on both sides of the
> tug-of-war (Southern-Dem 10% plan vs Radical-Rep Ironclad/Mass-Trials) and the
> choice STILL deadlocked — neither plan passed and states drifted back with NO
> plan at all (`hd1#POST 2678`). So the blocker is **STRUCTURAL, not a CPU-only
> artifact** (competing humans filibustered each other to the same null result).
> vcczar's authoritative rewrite (#156) **fixes it**: ALL readmissions require 'a
> plan adopted by Congress OR by the President', so the **President can adopt a plan
> UNILATERALLY** via the exec path — guaranteeing Reconstruction resolves in BOTH
> solo and deadlocked-human play with NO CPU vote required. **The readmission half
> (d) therefore NO LONGER HARD-depends on E9 handler #2 for the SOLO case** — it
> ships on the #156 unilateral-adopt path (K2 exec action). The CPU default-vote
> bias (option 1) + the era-boundary auto-resolution (option 3) remain useful
> belt-and-suspenders for the Congress-driven case, but are no longer solo gates.
> DH-29 is now a **debt item with a designed fix in hand**, not an open blocker."

So #156's unilateral-adopt makes E3b's readmission half **less risky and solo-shippable
without the CPU handler suite** — its hardest open question (how Reconstruction ever
resolves solo) is now answered. E3b stays downstream of the keystones; the war half
(a–c) is still unblocked (and now carries #155's balance pass + #157's CSA seeding).

**★ Batch-7 lead C — IDEOLOGY-AS-CIRCLE is FOUNDATIONAL — a central-helper
refactor behind an era-gated flag; place it EARLY-ish (Phase-1 #5b / E5b)**
(tech-lead §9.1.7 / §9.6 lead #2 / divergence #19):
> "`IDEOLOGY_ORDER` (`types.ts:14`) is **LINEAR** and ideology distance is
> **open-coded at 10+ engine call sites** (`factionCenter` `phaseRunners.ts:715`,
> `stepToward` `:740`, conversion adjacency `:993-1003`, sponsor `:3548`, a
> private `firstContinentalCongress.ts:120` helper, + 3 UI pages) — **there is NO
> central distance helper today**. Add `ideologyDistance(a, b, circular)`, migrate
> the 10+ sites (behavior-preserving while `circular = false`), gate the wrap on
> `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?`. Steps 1-2 are **cheap and additive while the
> flag is off**, and they pay down a latent consistency risk — every later
> ideology consumer (the SCOTUS within-1-step auto-AYE §26.6, the conversion
> handler #6, the faction-center math) gets the single helper for free. **Not a
> keystone** (nothing blocks on it), but the cheapest while early and the most
> error-prone if deferred."

So E5b lands the helper + migration **before** E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n)
handlers, so they call it from day one rather than open-coding distance an
11th/12th time.

---

Carried batch-5 leads (still binding):

1. **K5 (`CpuController` scaffold) is a NEW late-keystone — after K0 + K2,
   parallel with K3/K4 + federalism** (tech-lead §9.6 call #1, §9.1.3 — the
   single most important batch-5 call):
   > "The shipped engine has **no agent-decision pass at all** (3 thin stubs
   > only). The §25 spec'd 15 subsystems have nowhere to live without it. K5
   > itself is ~120 lines (orchestrator + handler interface + tie-breaks + 2
   > `repair()` backfills + 1 determinism test). It **unlocks ~15 follow-on
   > handler PRs** that parallelize across contributors. K5 is a
   > force-multiplier, not a scenario gate — federalism + the 1856-arc epic
   > can ship with stubbed handlers and upgrade together."

   So K5 sits as the 6th Phase-0 keystone, parallel with K3/K4. The 15-handler
   suite is a single Phase-1 epic (E9) ordered by §6.6.1's handler-order table.

2. **Cabinet-confirmation system (DH-23) is XS-S, NOT M — because the broken
   system isn't built yet** (tech-lead §9.6 call #2, §9.3 #14):
   > "`runPhase_2_3_1_Cabinet` (`phaseRunners.ts:2158-2223`) is a one-step
   > scored pick with no Senate vote. So the fix is 'build the confirmation
   > step in the right shape from day one' (default-AYE baseline + Iron-Fist
   > Maj-Leader auto-AYE-own-picks + lobby-maximizer Admin-weighting), which
   > is CPU handler #4 (§6.6.1). Lands as a sibling of the cabinet-retention
   > refactor (Phase-1 #16)."

   So DH-23 is **not a quick-win**; it lands at E16 as the XS-S confirmation
   step + at E9 handler 9d for the CPU side.

3. **What's READY now vs. what still needs design** (tech-lead §9.6 call #3):
   > "**READY (no design task remaining):** the 13 §25 subsections #25.1–#25.8
   > + #25.10–#25.14 — all 15 CPU handlers can be authored against §25
   > verbatim. Plus #79 25/10/5 Justice drift, #80 ±3 swing cap, #82 veto
   > override 2/3, #83 midterm meter+enthusiasm, #85 5%/half-term
   > retire-death. **NEEDS DESIGN (parking lot):** divergence #10 / #84
   > contingent-election rules (5 rulesets invented mid-thread, no canonical
   > answer); §25.9 Iron-Fist split (the 6 child traits' exact names + cascade
   > rules); DH-1 filibustered-MUST-pass; DH-12 white-peace; DH-13
   > faithless-elector trigger; DH-14 era-aware bill impacts; DH-15
   > small-state multiplier."

   READY-now count went from ~30 to ~45+ this batch; needs-design grew from
   1 (DH-1) to 7 (DH-1 + #10/#84 + §25.9 + DH-12/13/14/15).

4. **BUG-0 is the cheapest win in the whole roadmap — do it first** (carried
   from batch 4):
   > "Verified: `RELOCATION_ATTEMPTS_PER_TURN = 5` at `types.ts:247`; one-line
   > const edit, no migration, no dependency."

   Sits at the very top of the quick-wins (QW0).

5. **Per-era point BANKING (#68) reshapes the era keystones + the win
   condition — not a new item** (carried from batch 4):
   > "The era boundary is a bank-and-zero + award + full 2.1.x→2.3.1 re-run +
   > content-swap pipeline; the per-era banks sum toward the (open) cross-era
   > win total. Build `advanceEra` with the bank step from the start."

6. **The Civil-War / Reconstruction epic lands EARLY-ish (E3b) because it
   COMPLETES a shipped scenario** (carried from batch 4):
   > "`scenario1856.ts` ships today but its era-event spine dead-ends at the
   > Trent Affair (1861); adding #56/#57/#58/#59 completes a half-finished
   > playable scenario."

   E3b sits right after generic war (E3) + K2, **not** behind federalism (E1)
   or the modern tail. **Batch 5 adds: it is the first scenario to get a full
   K5 handler suite — wire handlers as they land.**

7. **Generic war (E3) is DESIGNED multi-theater + tiered from day one — with
   the multi-confirmed formula** (tech-lead §9.6, sharpened batch 5):
   > "`drums` re-derives the formula `Win% = Difficulty + Planning + Officer×10
   > + MilPrep + Benchmarks` end-to-end across Eastern + Western + Utah + WWI
   > + Mexico + Sioux — the single most multiply-confirmed cross-era resolver
   > in the knowledge base. `WS ≥ +11` auto-win; war-end `WS×2 = %`; post-war
   > defeat `|WS|×2×10`; naval-N-then-ground per-war; Treaty A-D + 3-roll
   > chain. The Civil War is the Major-tier instance — a configured instance,
   > not a rewrite."

8. **K2 (ActionRegistry) remains the second-most-important keystone after K0**
   (~6× leverage across 6 action libraries) **AND is a hard prerequisite for
   K5** — most CPU handlers pick from a registry library. Do K2 first if only
   one keystone lands this quarter.

9. **The two-track parallelization is still the biggest schedule lever**
   (tech-lead §9.4, §9.6). Sync points: a handful of additive `Politician`/
   `Party` fields + two deeper handoffs (A4 ↔ E3 war odds; P2 ↔ E8 portraits).
   Start the presentation track immediately with P0.

10. **(carried) #8 cabinet, #7 SCOTUS, the two scaling walls, far-end vs
    near-term.** #8 is a real cabinet wipe→retention refactor (M, E16) —
    batch 2 wrongly said no wipe exists (`:3804-3812`). #7 SCOTUS is
    from-scratch over a *stub* (`:3398-3414`), far-end (E25). The two
    scaling walls (persist House slates E7; procedural pol gen E8) are
    NEAR-term, not modern-only. Federalism before gilded before modern;
    `scenario1788` before a fully-general `advanceEra`.

11. **RNG first (K0).** Determinism is the prerequisite for multiplayer
    AND for **K5's deterministic tie-breaks** (every CPU decision must be
    reproducible from the seed), AND any replay/test harness, a soft gate
    for every roll-heavy subsystem (war E3/E3b, convention E10, governor
    d100s E11, filibuster E14, primary E24), **and a hard gate for the
    seeded procedural pol generator (E8)**.

12. **Within-track dependency notes.** **E18g (numeric `nationalSurplus`/
    `nationalDebt`) is a prerequisite for E2's cap *and* E6's debt field —
    build that sub-item early.** E4's global flip + the 12A toggle need E5
    (amendments). **E4b (early-republic cluster) splits its deps: (a)
    slavery-flag+Cohens needs E25's SCOTUS docket [the `Cohens` rule-modifier]
    + E5 [the abolition amendment]; (b) Second Bank needs K2 + E13 + the E16
    dynamic seat list; (c) statehood-by-bill needs E21 + K3's `territoryOwned`
    predicate.** **E5b (ideology-as-circle) is independent but lands steps 1-2
    BEFORE E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n) handlers so they call the central
    helper from day one.** E21's statehood needs E2 + E3 + E8 + K3's
    `territoryOwned` predicate; **E3b's Canada arc (#60) needs E21's per-era
    admission gate.** **★★ BATCH-16: E3b's Reconstruction readmission half (DH-29)
    needs only E2 (bills) + K2 (the #156 plan-adopt exec action) for SOLO — #156's
    unilateral-adopt prerequisite REMOVES the hard dependency on E9 handler #2 (now
    an optional CPU-default-vote enhancement) and on K3's era-boundary auto-resolution
    (now optional backstop). DH-29 fix is designed-in-hand.** E10b's VP-vacancy fill needs
    E5. E14e (investigation) needs E2's bill type. E24 needs E10's CPU delegate
    engine + handler 9i. E26 needs E23. E28 needs E7. **All 15 E9 handlers
    need K5; 9k/9l also need K5's persistent state.** P1/P2/P3 consume P0.

### Estimate caution

Sizes are the tech-lead's. Rows that may still feel XL after a first pass:

- **E3 (generic war)** — sized M–L, but the **batch-9 + batch-15 + batch-16
  build-holes may push it toward the top of that range**: DH-47 adds a
  **resolution/peace path** (wars never end today) and **army/navy/air branches**;
  #152 adds the **war-defeat loss package + multi-phase carry**; and **batch-16
  #155 (M) adds the war-balance pass** (enemy-strength via `rng.ts` — also closing
  the `phaseRunners.ts:3603` `Math.random` determinism leak — + battle-size +
  Officer-Mil cap + per-theater), **bounded by keeping the 1772 RevWar winnable**.
  Ship the base resolver + the resolution path first (it is what makes the Cold-War
  wars, Korea, terminate); the branch model + #155 balance terms can be follow-on
  sub-PRs. Remember: this is the ONLY war engine — the Cold War relabels it.
- **E3b (Civil-War / Reconstruction)** — sized L but it is a full subsystem;
  **ship as 5+ sub-PRs** (secession #58 + #157 CSA seeding → sectional crisis #59
  → two-theater war #56 + CW variants #97 → Reconstruction #57 + #148 timer +
  **#156 4-plan model** → Canada #60), cheap-first.
  **★★ BATCH-16: the Reconstruction sub-PR (d) NO LONGER carries the DH-29
  solo-blocker as an E9-handler-#2 hard-gate** — #156's "plan adopted by Congress
  OR President" prerequisite lets the player-President adopt a plan UNILATERALLY via
  the K2 exec path, so the readmission half ships solo on the exec path with NO CPU
  vote required. DH-29's fix is now **designed in hand (#156)**, not an open blocker;
  the CPU default-vote bias (E9 handler #2) + K3 era-boundary auto-resolution remain
  optional belt-and-suspenders for the Congress-driven readmission case.
- **E1 (federalism / early-republic epic)** — sized L; expect the era-event
  spine and the SCOTUS set to each be their own sub-PR. The early-republic
  subsystems are folded OUT into E4 + E4b (sequenced after their keystones).
- **E4b (early-republic cluster)** — sized M but **3 independent sub-PRs**
  with different deps (slavery-flag+Cohens → SCOTUS docket + E5; Second Bank
  → K2 + E13 + E16 seat list; statehood-by-bill → E21 + K3's `territoryOwned`);
  ship them as they unblock, not as one epic.
- **E9 (CPU handler suite)** — **~15 PRs**, not one. Order by §6.6.1; ship
  one at a time. Handlers 9k/9l (the DH-* architectural gaps with persistent
  state) land **after** the simpler handlers have exercised the scaffold.
- **E10 (convention)** — the single biggest unbuilt subsystem; **split into
  ~3** (ballot loop → inter-ballot library on K2 → platform/VP/scandal).
  The CPU side is owned by handler 9e (E9), not by this epic.
- **E14 (legislative micro-mechanics)** — now **7 sub-PRs** sharing the bill
  pipeline (block-and-replace → packaging → filibuster → crisis tag →
  investigation #54 → veto override #82 → midterm #83).
- **E16 (cabinet + Congress + offices-by-law + confirmation + ★ batch-12 #124
  enthusiasm REWORK)** — **★★ batch-12 RE-SCOPED M (was L with a XS-S confirmation
  step inside)**. **Five coupled jobs** (9-role Congressional pipeline; cabinet-
  wipe→retention refactor; **confirmation + #124 enthusiasm rework BUILT TOGETHER
  from day one** — lobby = POINTS to `Faction.score?`, ideology composition =
  ENTHUSIASM via ±3-cap clamp; offices-created-by-law #66; dynamic seat list
  CREATE-AND-ABOLISH). **LANDS AFTER K2 + K5** (cabinet picks are CPU actions; uses
  the conditional-vote-rules primitive). **#124 numeric percentages stay designer-
  gated open** (Decision-gated "designer-gated" #8/#9); ship a const table that
  re-tunes post-design. **Split if any feels XL during scoping.**
- **E30 (modern era scenario)** — the XL capstone; decomposes into roster +
  era-event spine + bill catalog + card pool sub-PRs; gates on most of Phase
  1 + 2.
- **P2 (portrait pipeline)** — an asset-pipeline epic; the no-AI-in-product
  constraint shapes the tech choice from day one; must render generated pols
  (shared with E8).

  cabinet→enthusiasm REWORK from day one (lobby = POINTS to `Faction.score?`;
  ideology composition = ENTHUSIASM; numeric percentages stay designer-gated);
- **★ 18 OTHER TED-RULINGS sized + slotted into existing epics: 12 XS** (#135 / #136
  / #137 / #138 / #139 / #141 / #142 / #131 / #132), **5 S** (#126 / #127 / #128 /
  #129 / #130 / #133 / #140), **3 M** (#124 → E16, #134 → E6 Lingering 7-step + tax/
  tariff carry-forward, #120 dataset umbrella → ONE coordinated `scripts/seedDataset.mjs`
  pass);
- **★ E5 + E25 SIMPLIFIED** by the amendments-NOT-SCOTUS-challengeable build-target
  (vcczar `smallbugs#POST 250-269` OVERRIDES `tea1772` #100 — drop the SCOTUS-overturns-
  amendment branch from both rows; keep E5's strike-a-statute + mutable-threshold +
  #119 lifecycle, keep E25's docket + drift + DH-32 state-guard);
- **★ NEW Decision-gated sub-bucket "designer-gated"** (9 items, NOT ready-to-build
  until Ted/vcczar closes them in `tedchange`/`smallbugs`): Mil-Prep meter level 4
  fix, **#125 UEM**, Crisis trait consolidation, term-limit Gov actions in pre-Senate
  era, faithless-elector rewording, party rename PL-vs-EraEvo, VP-must-be-same-party-
  on-resignation, cabinet enthusiasm percentages (the #124 numeric), cabinet ideology
  weighting Big-4-vs-rest;
- **★ STRENGTHENINGS (no new rows):** **#76 (CPU conversion adjacency)** EXTENDED via
  `tedchange` (same-party can target same OR ADJACENT ideology); **#99 (ideology =
  circle)** now **TED-AUTHORITATIVE** (3-thread corroboration → designer-RULED, 25%
  rate pinned, Two-Faced auto-grant); **#67 (Lingering bank ordering)** RULED → #134
  (canonical 7-step + carry-forward); **#100 (Gov-requested SCOTUS review of
  amendments)** OVERRIDDEN by Ted/vcczar (mark superseded);
- **★ NEW gaps:** **#121** Secessionist trait missing from politicians dataset
  (XS — dataset addition + a one-row `Trait` union add; folds into #120 umbrella +
  E3b sub-PR (a)); **#122** pardon mechanics entirely unspecified → **NEW author-
  before-build item** (13th total; folds into E29 when authored); **#123** small late-
  modern content bundle (Wyoming Rule → Real House Act 585-cap, runoff-amendment,
  Senate-Abolish amendment) → folds into Phase-2 #28 / #30.

**This batch-10 pass (carried) is PROMOTION + decision-gating + small placements —
NO re-sequence, NO new keystone:**

- **★ PROMOTES the `scenarioBoot(BootSheet)` pipeline (#115) to the front of the
  subsystem queue, folded into K4's `BootSheet` schema** (NOT a new keystone): there
  are NO documented rules for CREATING a game; build the shared pipeline (K0 → boot
  rolls; `scenarioBoot` + `BootSheet` with K4; scenarios-as-data) WITH `scenario1788`
  (E1), before the third hand-authored copy. Venue for QW8/QW9 + the #115b appointment-
  ladder;
- **★ DECISION-GATES two forks** (new "Decision-gated" category, 2 items): #52
  player-controlled SCOTUS (3 models; docket needed either way → E25) + #18/#51
  meter→enthusiasm→election (3 models; settled ±3 cap → QW3, binding-point → E20/E23);
- **slots the sized fixes:** DH-53 structured bill-effect tables (S → E20 + K4),
  DH-24 Senate-class (XS → QW8/boot pipeline), focus-Rep (EV−2)/5 #55 (M → E7 + E28),
  statehood→sectional-crisis #59 (S → E3b additive at `admitState`), #115b appointment-
  ladder + replacement-gains (XS → boot/appointment rules, pairs with DH-25);
- **makes the #92 era-band model 4-START-CONFIRMED** (K3/K4 confidence bump);
- **records the 2nd GA-burnout DEATH (DH-36) as the prioritization ARGUMENT** for the
  upkeep-reducing items (#115, #55, E7, K5/E9) — NOT a row; author-before-build count
  stays **12**.

And the batch-9 pass that this one leaves UNCHANGED in order — **CONFIDENCE +
NEGATIVE-SCOPE + small placements, NO re-sequence, NO new keystone:**

- **★ K3/K4 (the era model) is now 3-START-CONFIRMED** (1772 + 1800 + **1948**)
  and gains a **TWO-LEVEL refinement** (point-banked Historical Eras carrying
  rule-deltas + a separate per-decade census doing EV-realloc + bias-re-lean +
  content-rotation; do NOT collapse them) **+ a STRUCTURED-era-event-data
  requirement** (DH-48, typed `evDelta`/census fields + per-era validation); the
  "Neocons" mislabel is logged as a faction-rebrand, NOT a band;
- **★★ records the NEGATIVE-SCOPE Cold-War guard** — there is NO Cold-War
  subsystem to build (only `revolutionaryWar.ts` exists); the Cold War = the
  generic war engine (E3) + the diplomacy subsystem (E12) + content (data), and
  those two rows gain the real build-holes (E3 must RESOLVE — DH-47; E12 needs
  downward pressure + the USSR-collapse fix — DH-45/46);
- **★ elevates K5 + the E9 handler suite to a first-class LOAD-BEARING Phase-1
  system** (the APP is 1-human-vs-9-CPU, #114; K5's placement is unchanged);
- **strengthens E16** (create-AND-abolish cabinet seats), **E25** (legislated
  variable SCOTUS size), and folds the modern election/institutional layer + the
  `scenario1948` 4th-boot + DH-45..DH-58 into existing epics;
- **records the Senate threshold as resolved-in-code (simple majority) / the
  60%-cloture question as an OPEN human decision**;
- **adds DH-49 (population model + House cap — the one new infra item) + DH-54
  (impeachment/succession ruleset) to the parking lot → 12.**

And the batch-8 confidence-hardening pass that this one leaves UNCHANGED in order:

- **★ bumps K3/K4 (the era model) to HIGHEST confidence — MULTI-SAVE PROVEN**
  (§9.1.5 batch-8 bump): `tea1772` (1772-start) + `rep1800` (1800-start, 28 in-game
  years apart) emit the identical era-band sequence at identical dates (#102), so
  the content-band model is settled. No structural change; **#102's dual
  era-scoring (per-era + cumulative) is the WIN-CONDITION scoreboard**, folded into
  K3/K4 point-banking (#68);
- **★ strengthens E16's dynamic-seat refactor justification** —
  `cabinetSeatsForYear` confirmed the WRONG model at BOTH ends (founding
  offices-by-law `new1772` §24.6 + modern bill-creates-a-seat `pop`), no new work;
- **★ adds DH-41 to the author-before-build parking lot (now 10 total)** — the
  general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade, UNBUILT and `vcczar`-deferred;
- **folds the new small mechanics into existing epics:** #100 (SCOTUS-overturns-
  amendment + amendable-threshold) → E5 + E25; #103 (pres-vote modifier stack +
  era-issue list) + DH-42 (meter-vs-lean balance) → E20; #104 (lone-ideology
  convention exploit) → E9 handler 9e; #105 (stat-collapse → forced resignation) →
  E10b; DH-38 (late-ratification/Rogue-Island window) → E1; DH-40 (justice-count
  not packaged → stall) → E14b + E25 (XS-S); DH-44 (post-12A vote count) → E4;
- **adds QW11** (DH-43 Vermont home-state dataset fix, XS);
- **parks** DH-37 (no pol-trading, #1 AMPU-2 wishlist) + DH-39 (all-human
  Convention deadlock) on the multiplayer track;
- **★ records the NEGATIVE RESULT** — no thread reaches a "future" era, so the
  roadmap does NOT scope one (K4 adds exactly `gilded` + `progressive`);
- **cites DH-36** (GM burnout abandoned a 12-turn game) as the META justification
  for the whole build (intro rationale, not a queued row).

The batch-7 re-sequence that this pass leaves UNCHANGED:

- **★ re-specs K3 + K4 for the era-model reframe — NOT a new keystone** (§9.1.5 /
  divergence #18): `advanceEra(snap)` becomes condition-driven (game-state /
  meter / TERRITORY, per half-term — no `target` arg; the CC `:198` line becomes
  the first `advanceWhen` condition); content gates on `game.eraBand` + a new
  `territoryOwned` predicate (one predicate, three consumers), not the calendar;
  the early sub-bands (Republicanism/Democracy/Manifest-Destiny) are content-band
  markers; the per-era content-band registry `{bills, eraEvents, draftees,
  biasTable, advanceWhen}` lands at K4. **Reconciles #68 + §26 + §27.1 into one
  era system.** `year % 4`/`year % 2` stay as phase cadence;
- **★★ adds the Reconstruction solo-blocker (DH-29) as a hard DoD requirement on
  E3b** (§9.1.6): the Strict/Ironclad readmission plan can NEVER pass with CPU →
  solo Reconstruction unwinnable; E3b's readmission half must ship a CPU
  default-vote bias (E9 handler #2) AND/OR an era-boundary auto-resolution (K3);
  ties E3b to the CPU handler suite;
- **★ adds ideology-as-circle as Phase-1 #5b (E5b)** (§9.1.7 / divergence #19):
  a central `ideologyDistance(a,b,circular)` helper + migration of the 10+
  open-coded sites, behind a `GameState.ideologyIsCircular?` flag — placed early
  so E9's conversion (9f) + SCOTUS (9n) handlers call it from day one;
- **folds the early-republic subsystems into E1 + Phase-1 #4/#4b** (E4 12A
  legislature-elector toggle #93; new E4b = slavery-flag+Cohens #94 [SMALLER —
  `State.isSlaveState` already exists] + Second Bank+Bank War #95 +
  statehood-by-bill organize→admit + territory-gate #95);
- **merges era-events-predating-start into BUG-1 (QW1)** — LIVE-confirmed by the
  LA-Purchase-dropped-at-1800-start episode — and **adds DH-30
  event-scheduler-min-floor as QW10**, BUG-1's companion;
- **places DH-31** (procedure-bill veto-misroute) at E2, **DH-32** (SCOTUS-voids-
  a-state guard + the `Cohens` ruling-bill-class modifier) at E25, **DH-35**
  (era-gate the action libraries) at E11/E13/E24;
- **adds DH-33** (impeachment-rewrite) to author-before-build (E29) and **resolves
  DH-34** as a roadmap DECISION (ship static era-biases — the forum's own stance);
- **notes `scenario1800` (E32)** as an optional later `BootSheet` instance (the
  band is already covered by `scenario1788` + `scenario1856`).

And the batch-8 confidence-hardening pass leaves all of the above **unchanged in
order** — it bumps K3/K4 to HIGHEST confidence (multi-save proven), strengthens
E16's justification, adds DH-41 to the parking lot, folds #100/#103/#104/#105 +
DH-38/39/40/42/43/44 into existing epics, adds QW11 (Vermont), and records the
no-future-era guard + the DH-36 META rationale.

And the **batch-9 pass (this one)** leaves ALL of the above **unchanged in order** —
it makes K3/K4 3-START-CONFIRMED + adds the two-level era refinement + the
structured-era-event-data requirement (all inside K3/K4), records the NEGATIVE-SCOPE
Cold-War guard (the Cold War = E3 + E12 + content), elevates K5 + E9 to load-bearing
(placement unchanged), strengthens E16 (create-AND-abolish) + E25 (legislated court
size), folds the modern election/institutional layer + `scenario1948` + DH-45..DH-58
into existing epics, records the Senate-threshold resolution, and adds DH-49 + DH-54
to the parking lot (→ 12).

And the batch-12 pass (this one) is **DESIGNER-RULINGS INTEGRATION + QW0 FULLY
CLOSES + ONE M-rework + 19 sized Ted-rulings slotted + ~100-item dataset umbrella +
build-target simplification on E5/E25 + Decision-gated split into user-gated +
designer-gated buckets**: it leaves all of the above order **unchanged** and
strengthens the order (QW0 is now the top-of-queue; E16 is RE-SCOPED M with #124
bundled; E5 + E25 simplified by Ted/vcczar's amendments-NOT-SCOTUS ruling; 9 new
designer-gated parking items added) **without** moving any keystone, splitting any
epic, or re-sequencing the spine.

**Still provisional.** Subsequent `/ingest-playtest` runs will refine scopes
(especially the CPU handler internals, the contingent-election rules, the
§25.9 split, the convention CPU specifics, the Civil-War sub-splits, the
~16-meter Lingering order, **the war resolution/peace + branch model (DH-47), the
diplomacy downward-pressure tuning (DH-45/46),** and the cross-era win-total number
the per-era banks sum to), may re-split currently L-sized rows, and may surface
items now parked or unknown. **The order above is buildable top-to-bottom today;
re-validate on every digest.** Open design calls that gate ordering
(contingent-election rules, §25.9 Iron-Fist split, DH-12 white-peace, DH-13
faithless-elector cap, DH-14 era-aware bill ideology, DH-15 small-state
multiplier, era-event scheduling hybrid, era-enum split, meter relabel,
procedural-generation distribution, DH-1 filibuster remedy, **DH-33 impeachment
rewrite**, **DH-41 the general SCOTUS-ruling → downstream-statute cascade policy
[batch 8 — author before building it into E25]**, draft 3/3-canonical, Civil-War
end-year, cross-era win total, the batch-7 era-model open Qs (are the early
sub-bands content-band markers or enum values [tech-lead's call: markers first];
the exact scope of the `territoryOwned` content-gate; which Reconstruction
readmission fix E3b ships [CPU bias #1 vs era-boundary auto-resolution #3 vs both
— tech-lead's rec: 1+3]), **and the batch-9 open Qs — the POPULATION-MODEL + House-
cap rule [DH-49, author before the census + Wyoming-Rule]; the impeachment / VP-
vacancy / succession ruleset [DH-54]; the war resolution + branch model [DH-47]; and
the human's Senate-threshold call [simple-majority-in-code vs require 60%/cloture];
**and the designer-gated open items — 9 OPEN bullets after the ★★ batch-15 −2 recount
(the #124-percentages gate, B8+B9, RESOLVED OUT via the live 3-state tuning; #18
state-scope RESOLVED OUT to E20b): Mil-Prep meter level 4 fix, UEM #125, Crisis trait
consolidation, term-limit Gov in pre-Senate era, faithless-elector rewording, party
rename PL-vs-EraEvo, VP-must-be-same-party-on-resignation, OC-4 off-ideology draft gate,
OC-8 define-an-office — all NOT ready-to-build until Ted/vcczar closes them in
`tedchange`/`smallbugs`; PLUS #122 pardon mechanics (NEW author-before-build). NOTE
DH-47's must-resolve half is now COMPLETED by #152 (war-defeat loss package + multi-phase
→ E3); only the army/navy/air BRANCH model remains open.**)
are tracked in `game-context.md` → Open questions.
